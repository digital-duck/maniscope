      "[SARS-CoV-2 infection with gastrointestinal symptoms as the first manifestation in a neonate]. Since December 2019, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The infected cases were noted mostly in adults, but rarely reported in children, especially neonates. Most children with SARS-CoV-2 infection present mainly with respiratory symptoms, but less commonly with gastrointestinal symptoms, and tend to have mild clinical symptoms. A neonate with SARS-CoV-2 infection, who had vomiting and milk refusal as the first symptom, was recently admitted to Wuhan Children's Hospital. After two weeks of treatment, the patient recovered gradually and was discharged. Here, this case is reported to improve the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection in neonates.",
      "Chapter 1 Introduction and Historical Perspective Publisher Summary The term molecular epidemiology emerged apparently independently during the 1970s to early 1980s in the literature of three separate substantive areas of epidemiology: cancer epidemiology, environmental epidemiology, and infectious disease epidemiology. Although these separate substantive areas agree that epidemiology refers to the distribution of disease in a population and the determinants of that distribution, the literature presents conflicting definitions of what makes a study a molecular epidemiologic study. In cancer and environmental epidemiology, molecular is defined almost exclusively in terms of biomarkers. However, biomarkers are only one type of molecular measure, and this definition ignores the many applications of molecular methods in genetic and infectious disease epidemiology. Early epidemiologists made tremendous strides with what are now relatively simple molecular tools, such as using microscopy for identification, showing agents not visible by microscope cause disease, and detecting protective antibodies with hemagglutination assays. In the microbiology literature, molecular epidemiology has become synonymous with the use of molecular fingerprints\u2014regardless of whether the study was population based or met other criteria consistent with an epidemiologic study. Moreover, the molecular tools available, and the potential for applications for studies of populations, have changed substantially since the term molecular epidemiology was coined.",

      "Evaluation of the clinical characteristics of suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 during home care with isolation: A new retrospective analysis based on O2O Summary Background The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus in December 2019 (COVID-19) has activated top-level response nationwide. We developed a new treatment model based on the online-to-offline (O2O) model for the home isolated patients, because in the early stages the medical staff were insufficient to cope with so many patients. Methods In this single-centered, retrospective study, we enrolled 48 confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients who underwent home isolation in Wuhan between January 6 and January 31, 2020. By WeChat and online document editing all patients were treated with medical observation scale. The clinical indications such as Fever, Muscle soreness, Dyspnea and Lack of strength were collected with this system led by medical staff in management, medicine, nursing, rehabilitation and psychology. Findings The mean(SD) age of 48 patients was 39.08(13.88) years, 35(72.9%) were women. Compared with non-hospitalized patients, inpatients were older(\u22658805;70years, 2.4% vs 33.3%, P<0.04). All inpatients had fever, 50% inpatients had coughs and showed infiltration in both lungs at the time of diagnosis. 33.3% inpatients exhibited negative changes in their CT results at initial diagnosis. The body temperature of non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms returned to normal by day 4-5. While dyspnea peaked on day 6 for non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms, it persisted in hospitalized patients and exacerbated over time. The lack of strength and muscle soreness were both back to normal by day 4 for non-hospitalized patients. Interpretation Monitoring the trends of symptoms is more important for identifying severe cases. Excessive laboratory data and physical examination are not necessary for the evaluation of patients with mild symptoms. The system we developed is the first to convert the subjective symptoms of patients into objective scores. This type of O2O, subjective-to-objective strategy may be used in regions with similar highly infectious diseases to minimize the possibility of infection among medical staff.",

      "The SARS, MERS and novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemics, the newest and biggest global health threats: what lessons have we learned? OBJECTIVES: To provide an overview of the three major deadly coronaviruses and identify areas for improvement of future preparedness plans, as well as provide a critical assessment of the risk factors and actionable items for stopping their spread, utilizing lessons learned from the first two deadly coronavirus outbreaks, as well as initial reports from the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic in Wuhan, China. METHODS: Utilizing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA) website, and a comprehensive review of PubMed literature, we obtained information regarding clinical signs and symptoms, treatment and diagnosis, transmission methods, protection methods and risk factors for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19. Comparisons between the viruses were made. RESULTS: Inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation, and limited reporting on the virus within China has, in part, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout mainland China and into proximal and distant countries. Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due in part to increased globalization and the focus of the epidemic. Wuhan, China is a large hub connecting the North, South, East and West of China via railways and a major international airport. The availability of connecting flights, the timing of the outbreak during the Chinese (Lunar) New Year, and the massive rail transit hub located in Wuhan has enabled the virus to perforate throughout China, and eventually, globally. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that we did not learn from the two prior epidemics of coronavirus and were ill-prepared to deal with the challenges the COVID-19 epidemic has posed. Future research should attempt to address the uses and implications of internet of things (IoT) technologies for mapping the spread of infection.",

Data from several countries have demonstrated higher morbidity and mortality among individuals with chronic metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus (DM). In this review, we explore the contributing factors for poorer prognosis in these individuals. As a significant proportion of patients with COVID-19 also have DM, this adds another layer of complexity to their management. We explore potential interactions between anti-diabetic medications and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system inhibitors with COVID-19. Suggested recommendations for the use of anti-diabetic medications in COVID-19 patients with DM are provided. We also review pertinent clinical considerations in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis in the COVID-19 patient. In addition, we aim to increase the awareness of clinicians to the metabolic effects of promising drug therapies for COVID-19. Finally, we highlight the importance of timely vaccinations for patients with DM.",
      "Clinical characteristics and outcome of ICU admitted MERS corona virus infected patients Abstract Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a novel respiratory illness firstly reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. It is caused by a new corona virus, called MERS corona virus (MERS-CoV). Most people who have MERS-CoV infection developed severe acute respiratory illness. Aim of the work This work is done to determine the clinical characteristics and the outcome of intensive care unit (ICU) admitted patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection. Patients and methods This study included 32 laboratory confirmed MERS corona virus infected patients who were admitted into ICU. It included 20 (62.50%) males and 12 (37.50%) females. The mean age was 43.99\u00b113.03years. Diagnosis was done by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test for corona virus on throat swab, sputum, tracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. Clinical characteristics, co-morbidities and outcome were reported for all subjects. Results The main symptoms among the included patients were: fever (96.87%), cough (93.75%), dyspnea (90.62%), sore throat (75%), runny nose (75%), sputum (50%), headache (43.75%), myalgia (40.62%), chest pain (37.50%), hemoptysis (37.50%), nausea and vomiting (34.37%), abdominal pain (21.87%) and diarrhea (15.62%). The presence of abdominal symptoms is significantly (P <0.05) associated with bad prognosis. Out of the included 32 patients, 18 patients (56.25%) survived and 14 patients (43.75%) expired. There was a statistically significant difference in the duration of symptoms before hospitalization, mechanical ventilation and ICU and total hospital stay between the expired group and survivors (P <0.01). Current smoking and smoking severity were statistically significantly (P <0.01) higher in the expired group compared to survivors. Also, there was a statistically (P <0.05) significant positive correlation between mortality and smoking severity (r =0.640). Most of the expired patients presented with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates or unilateral infiltrates, but most of the survivors presented with normal radiology or increased bronchovascular markings, and this difference in the results was statistically highly significant (P <0.01). There were statistically highly significant (P <0.01) differences in the mean values of APACHE II score (21.11\u00b13.70 vs 24.21\u00b13.82), SOFA score (5.83\u00b12.64 vs 8.85\u00b12.17) and CPIS (7.55\u00b11.14 vs 8.64\u00b11.39) between the expired group and survivors respectively. Also, there was a statistically significant decrease in PH, PaO2, O2 saturation and HCO3 (P <0.05) among the expired group in comparison with the survivors, but no statistical difference regarding PaCO2 (P >0.05). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between mortality and old age (r =0.633), obesity (r =0.712), diabetes mellitus (r =0.685), renal failure (r =0.705), chronic heart diseases (0.591), COPD (r =0.523), malignancy (r =0.692), kidney transplantation (r =0.644) and liver cirrhosis (r =0.525) (P <0.05). There was a statistically (P <0.05) positive correlation between the number of associated co-morbidities and mortality (r =0.735). Conclusions Most MERS corona patients present with fever, cough, dyspnea, sore throat, runny nose and sputum. The presence of abdominal symptoms may indicate bad prognosis. Prolonged duration of symptoms before patients\u2019 hospitalization, prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay, bilateral radiological pulmonary infiltrates, and hypoxemic respiratory failure were found to be strong predictors of mortality in such patients. Also, old age, current smoking, smoking severity, presence of associated co-morbidities like obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic heart diseases, COPD, malignancy, renal failure, renal transplantation and liver cirrhosis are associated with a poor outcome of ICU admitted MERS corona virus infected patients.",
      "Association of diabetes and hypertension with disease severity in covid-19 patients: a systematic literature review and exploratory meta-analysis AIM: The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19), now a worldwide public health concern is associated with varied fatality. Patients with chronic underlying conditions like diabetes and hypertension have shown worst outcomes. The understanding of the association might be helpful in early vigilant monitoring and better management of COVID-19 patients at high risk. The aim of the meta-analysis was to assess the association of diabetes and hypertension with severity of disease. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed and Cochrane until March 31, 2020. Seven studies were included in the meta- analysis, including 2018 CIVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Diabetes was lower in the survivors (OR: 0.56; 95%CI: 0.35-0.90; p=0.017; I2: 0.0%) and non-severe (OR: 1.66; 95%CI: 1.20-2.30; p=0.002; I2: 0.0%) patients. No association of diabetes was found with ICU care. Hypertension was positively associated with death (OR: 0.49; 95%CI: 0.34-0.73; p=0.000; I2: 0.0%), ICU care (OR: 0.42; 95%CI: 0.22-0.81; p=0.009; I2: 0.0%) and severity (OR: 2.69; 95%CI: 1.27-5.73; p=0.01; I2: 52.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that diabetes and hypertension have a negative effect on health status of COVID-19 patients. However, large prevalence studies demonstrating the consequences of comorbid diabetes and hypertension are urgently needed to understand the magnitude of these vexatious comorbidities.",

      "Phenotypic characteristics and prognosis of inpatients with COVID-19 and diabetes: the CORONADO study AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a life-threatening infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Diabetes has rapidly emerged as a major comorbidity for COVID-19 severity. However, the phenotypic characteristics of diabetes in COVID-19 patients are unknown. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide multicentre observational study in people with diabetes hospitalised for COVID-19 in 53 French centres in the period 10-31 March 2020. The primary outcome combined tracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation and/or death within 7 days of admission. Age- and sex-adjusted multivariable logistic regressions were performed to assess the prognostic value of clinical and biological features with the endpoint. ORs are reported for a 1 SD increase after standardisation. RESULTS: The current analysis focused on 1317 participants: 64.9% men, mean age 69.8 \u00b1 13.0 years, median BMI 28.4 (25th-75th percentile: 25.0-32.7) kg/m2; with a predominance of type 2 diabetes (88.5%). Microvascular and macrovascular diabetic complications were found in 46.8% and 40.8% of cases, respectively. The primary outcome was encountered in 29.0% (95% CI 26.6, 31.5) of participants, while 10.6% (9.0, 12.4) died and 18.0% (16.0, 20.2) were discharged on day 7. In univariate analysis, characteristics prior to admission significantly associated with the primary outcome were sex, BMI and previous treatment with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers, but not age, type of diabetes, HbA1c, diabetic complications or glucose-lowering therapies. In multivariable analyses with covariates prior to admission, only BMI remained positively associated with the primary outcome (OR 1.28 [1.10, 1.47]). On admission, dyspnoea (OR 2.10 [1.31, 3.35]), as well as lymphocyte count (OR 0.67 [0.50, 0.88]), C-reactive protein (OR 1.93 [1.43, 2.59]) and AST (OR 2.23 [1.70, 2.93]) levels were independent predictors of the primary outcome. Finally, age (OR 2.48 [1.74, 3.53]), treated obstructive sleep apnoea (OR 2.80 [1.46, 5.38]), and microvascular (OR 2.14 [1.16, 3.94]) and macrovascular complications (OR 2.54 [1.44, 4.50]) were independently associated with the risk of death on day 7. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATIONS: In people with diabetes hospitalised for COVID-19, BMI, but not long-term glucose control, was positively and independently associated with tracheal intubation and/or death within 7 days.

      "Beveridgean Unemployment Gap This paper proposes a new method to estimate the unemployment gap (the actual unemployment rate minus the efficient rate). While lowering unemployment puts more people into work, it forces firms to post more vacancies and devote more resources to recruiting. This unemployment-vacancy tradeoff, governed by the Beveridge curve, determines the efficient unemployment rate. Accordingly, the unemployment gap can be measured from three sufficient statistics: the elasticity of the Beveridge curve, cost of recruiting, and social cost of unemployment. In the United States the unemployment gap is countercyclical, reaching 1.5--6.5 percentage points in slumps. Thus the US labor market appears inefficient---especially inefficiently slack in slumps.",
      "The Clinical and Chest CT Features Associated With Severe and Critical COVID-19 Pneumonia OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical and computed tomography (CT) features associated with severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-three patients with COVID-19 pneumonia including 25 severe/critical cases and 58 ordinary cases were enrolled. The chest CT images and clinical data of them were reviewed and compared. The risk factors associated with disease severity were analyzed. RESULTS: Compared with the ordinary patients, the severe/critical patients had older ages, higher incidence of comorbidities, cough, expectoration, chest pain, and dyspnea. The incidences of consolidation, linear opacities, crazy-paving pattern, and bronchial wall thickening in severe/critical patients were significantly higher than those of the ordinary patients. Besides, severe/critical patients showed higher incidences of lymph node enlargement, pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion than the ordinary patients. The CT scores of severe/critical patients were significantly higher than those of the ordinary patients (P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve showed that the sensitivity and specificity of CT score were 80.0% and 82.8%, respectively, for the discrimination of the 2 types. The clinical factors of age older than 50 years, comorbidities, dyspnea, chest pain, cough, expectoration, decreased lymphocytes, and increased inflammation indicators were risk factors for severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia. Computed tomography findings of consolidation, linear opacities, crazy-paving pattern, bronchial wall thickening, high CT scores, and extrapulmonary lesions were features of severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in clinical symptoms, laboratory examinations, and CT manifestations between the ordinary patients and the severe/critical patients. Many factors are related to the severity of the disease, which can help clinicians to judge the severity of the patient and evaluate the prognosis.",

To examine the association between these medications and COVID-19 infection or hospitalization, we conducted a retrospective cohort study within a US integrated healthcare system. Among people aged [\u2265]18 years enrolled in the health plan for at least 4 months as of 2/29/2020, current ACEI and ARB use was identified from pharmacy data, and the estimated daily dose was calculated and standardized across medications. COVID-19 infections were identified through 6/14/2020 from laboratory and hospitalization data. We used logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals. Among 322,044 individuals, 720 developed COVID-19 infection. Among people using ACEI/ARBs, 183/56,105 developed COVID-19 (3.3 per 1000 individuals) compared with 537/265,939 without ACEI/ARB use (2.0 per 1000), yielding an adjusted OR of 0.94 (95% CI 0.75-1.16). For use of < 1 defined daily dose vs. nonuse, the adjusted OR for infection was 0.89 (95% CI 0.62-1.26); for 1 to < 2 defined daily doses, 0.97 (95% CI 0.71-1.31); and for [\u2265]2 defined daily doses, 0.94 (95% CI 0.72-1.23). The OR was similar for ACEIs and ARBs and in subgroups by age and sex. 29% of people with COVID-19 infection were hospitalized; the adjusted OR for hospitalization in relation to ACEI/ARB use was 0.92 (95% CI 0.54-1.57), and there was no association with dose.

      "Bioinformatic characterization of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 epidemic a public health emergency of international concern on March 11th, 2020, and the pandemic is rapidly spreading worldwide. COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which enters human target cells via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We used a number of bioinformatics tools to computationally characterize ACE2 by determining its cell-specific expression in trachea, lung, and small intestine, derive its putative functions, and predict transcriptional regulation. The small intestine expressed higher levels of ACE2 than any other organ. The large intestine, kidney and testis showed moderate signals, whereas the signal was weak in the lung. Single cell RNA-Seq data from trachea indicated positive signals along the respiratory tract in key protective cell types including club, goblet, proliferating, and ciliary epithelial cells; while in lung the ratio of ACE2-expressing cells was low in all cell types (<2.6%), but was highest in vascular endothelial and goblet cells. Gene ontology analysis suggested that, besides its classical role in renin-angiotensin system, ACE2 may be functionally associated with angiogenesis/blood vessel morphogenesis. Using a novel tool for the prediction of transcription factor binding sites we identified several putative binding sites within two tissue-specific promoters of the ACE2 gene. Our results also confirmed that age and gender play no significant role in the regulation of ACE2 mRNA expression in the lung. IMPORTANCE Vaccines and new medicines are urgently needed to prevent spread of COVID-19 pandemic, reduce the symptoms, shorten the duration of disease, prevent virus spread in the body, and most importantly to save lives. One of the key drug targets could be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is a crucial receptor for the corona virus (SARS-CoV-2). It is known that SARS coronavirus infections lead to worse outcome in the elderly and in males. Therefore, one aim of the present study was to investigate whether age or sex could contribute to the regulation of ACE2 expression. We also decided to explore the transcriptional regulation of ACE2 gene expression. Since data on ACE2 distribution is still conflicting, we aimed to get a more comprehensive view of the cell types expressing the receptor of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we studied the coexpression of ACE2 with other genes and explored its putative functions using gene ontology enrichment analysis.",
      "Genotyping of clinically relevant human adenoviruses by array-in-well hybridization assay A robust oligonucleotide array-in-well hybridization assay using novel up-converting phosphor reporter technology was applied for genotyping clinically relevant human adenovirus types.

After a real-time PCR amplification targeting the adenovirus hexon gene, the array-in-well assay identified the presence of B03 (n = 122; 57.5% of patients), E04 (29; 13.7%), C02 (21; 9.9%), D37 (14; 6.6%), C01 (12; 5.7%), C05 (5; 2.4%), D19 (4; 1.9%), C06 (2; 0.9%), D08 (1; 0.5%), A31 (1; 0.5%) and F41 (1; 0.5%) genotypes among the clinical sample panel. The typing result was obtained for all specimens that could be amplified (n = 223; 97%), and specificity of the typing was confirmed by sequencing specimens representing each of the different genotypes. No hybridization signal was obtained in adenovirus-negative specimens or specimens with other viruses (n = 30). The array-in-well hybridization assay has great potential as a rapid and multiplex platform for the typing of clinically relevant human adenovirus genotypes in different specimen types.",

      "Emergency trauma care during the outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, in December 2019; the outbreak was caused by a novel coronavirus previously never observed in humans. China has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of the disease. However, a high level of evidence to support the surgical management of potential trauma patients during the novel coronavirus outbreak is still lacking. To regulate the emergency treatment of trauma patients during the outbreak, we drafted this paper from a trauma surgeon perspective according to practical experience in Wuhan. MAIN BODY: The article illustrates the general principles for the triage and evaluation of trauma patients during the outbreak of COVID-19, indications for emergency surgery, and infection prevention and control for medical personnel, providing a practical algorithm for trauma care providers during the outbreak period. CONCLUSIONS: The measures of emergency trauma care that we have provided can protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of effective interventions during the outbreak of COVID-19.",

We developed a new treatment model based on the online-to-offline (O2O) model for the home isolated patients, because in the early stages the medical staff were insufficient to cope with so many patients. Methods In this single-centered, retrospective study, we enrolled 48 confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients who underwent home isolation in Wuhan between January 6 and January 31, 2020. By WeChat and online document editing all patients were treated with medical observation scale. The clinical indications such as Fever, Muscle soreness, Dyspnea and Lack of strength were collected with this system led by medical staff in management, medicine, nursing, rehabilitation and psychology. Findings The mean(SD) age of 48 patients was 39.08(13.88) years, 35(72.9%) were women. Compared with non-hospitalized patients, inpatients were older(\u22658805;70years, 2.4% vs 33.3%, P<0.04). All inpatients had fever, 50% inpatients had coughs and showed infiltration in both lungs at the time of diagnosis. 33.3% inpatients exhibited negative changes in their CT results at initial diagnosis. The body temperature of non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms returned to normal by day 4-5. While dyspnea peaked on day 6 for non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms, it persisted in hospitalized patients and exacerbated over time. The lack of strength and muscle soreness were both back to normal by day 4 for non-hospitalized patients. Interpretation Monitoring the trends of symptoms is more important for identifying severe cases. Excessive laboratory data and physical examination are not necessary for the evaluation of patients with mild symptoms. The system we developed is the first to convert the subjective symptoms of patients into objective scores. This type of O2O, subjective-to-objective strategy may be used in regions with similar highly infectious diseases to minimize the possibility of infection among medical staff.",
      "An Ounce of Prevention: Coronavirus (COVID-19) and Mass Gatherings Widespread, non-stop, and often sensational coverage of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has caught many governments flat-footed in efforts to protect the health and safety of their citizens. In response to the current global health event, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Mass gatherings present a historic challenge in protecting the health and safety of attendees. The majority of the prominent mass gatherings are religious in nature. Global sporting events, such as the Olympics and the World Cup, pose unique health risks to attendees and host nations. Deferment or cancellation of such mass gatherings may exert an extraordinary economic loss to the host nation. Universal adoption of best practices for infection control is the surest way for governments to prepare for mass gatherings. In these uncertain times, it is up to intergovernmental organizations to be the voice of reason.",
      "Self-Isolation Compliance In The COVID-19 Era Influenced By Compensation: Findings From A Recent Survey In Israel. A new Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak is spreading since December 2019. In an attempt to contain the disease, health authorities call for self-quarantine of individuals suspected as exposures. Health officials assume the public will comply in high rates; however, studies suggest that a major obstacle to compliance for household quarantine is concern over loss of income. A cross sectional study of the adult population of Israel was conducted in the last week of February 2020 to assess public attitudes toward the COVID-19 outbreak. In particular, public compliance rates with self-quarantine were assessed depending on compensation for lost wages. The results suggest that when compensation was assumed, the compliance rate was 94%; yet, when compensation was removed, the compliance rate dropped to less than 57%. This study demonstrates that providing people with assurances for their livelihood during self-quarantine is an important component in compliance with public health regulations.

      "Estimating the risk of 2019 Novel Coronavirus death during the course of the outbreak in China, 2020 Since the first case of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China, the number of cases continues to grow across China and multiple cases have been exported to other countries. The cumulative number of reported deaths is at 637 as of February 7, 2020. Here we statistically estimated the time-delay adjusted death risk for Wuhan as well as for China excluding Wuhan to interpret the current severity of the epidemic in China. We found that the latest estimates of the death risk in Wuhan could be as high as 20% in the epicenter of the epidemic whereas we estimate it ~1% in the relatively mildly-affected areas. Because the elevated death risk estimates are likely associated with a breakdown of the medical/health system, enhanced public health interventions including social distancing and movement restrictions should be effectively implemented to bring the epidemic under control.",

Abstract Introduction: Since the appearance of SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, we have experienced a reduction in admissions in our Service and a decrease in urgent surgical activity. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the incidence of potentially surgical abdominal emergency in our center during the epidemic of COVID-19. Methods: A retrospective study was designed. It included all patients admitted for urgent abdominal pathology with potential surgical treatment in our General and Digestive Surgery Department from February 24, 2020 to April 19, 2020. Results: Eighty-nine patients with a mean age of 58.85\u00b122.2 were included. The median time from symptom onset to the Emergency Department (ED) visit was 48 (P25-P75 = 24-96) hours. On arrival at the ED, 18 (20%) patients presented with systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria. Fifty-one (57%) surgical procedures were performed. The rate of post-surgical complications at 30 days was 31% and the mortality rate was 2%. Concerning the same period from 2017 to 2019, the mean number of admissions from the ED to our Department decreased by 14% during the epidemic period. Conclusion: There has been a decrease in the number of patients admitted for urgent, potentially surgical, abdominal pathology during the period of the COVID-19 epidemic in our center.",
      "Isolated pharmaco-mechanical thrombectomy (IPMT) for the endovascular treatment of acute axillofemoral graft occlusion. Since the long-term patency of axillofemoral (AXF) grafts is inferior to aorto-bifemoral (ABF) grafts, limb salvage procedures are crucial in this group of patients. Emerging endovascular devices have helped in the successful restoration of flow for acute limb ischemia in both native arteries as well as bypass grafts. One such device, the Trellis thrombectomy system is being used more frequently in this setting. The device has previously been used in veins, native arteries, and rarely in aortofemoral grafts. We present its first successful use for the treatment of occluded AXF bypass graft. The use of this device helped to isolate the treatment zone in the occluded graft, which allowed the use of a lower dose of thrombolytics, less systemic release of thrombolytics, and less distal embolization. Resolution of extensive clot burden was achieved and, with subsequent stenting of the graft at the distal anastomotic site, arterial flow to the leg through the AXF graft was restored and a revision surgery was avoided.",

      "Protecting and Improving the Lives of Older Adults in the COVID-19 Era The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the lives of people throughout the world, either directly, due to exposure to the virus, or indirectly, due to measures taken to mitigate the virus' effects. Older adults have been particularly hard hit, dying in disproportionately higher numbers, especially in long-term care facilities. Local, regional, and national government actions taken to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 have thus served, in part, to shield older adults from the virus, though not without adverse side effects, including increased social isolation, enhanced economic risk, revealed ageism, delayed medical treatment, and challenges getting basic needs met. This special issue of the Journal of Aging & Social Policy explores the myriad ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic has affected older adults and their families, caregivers, and communities. It proposes policies and strategies for protecting and improving the lives of older people during the pandemic. It draws lessons for aging policy and practice more generally, given underlying challenges brought to the fore by government, provider, community, and individual responses to the pandemic."

      "Clinical Vignettes: Donor-Derived Infections Patients undergoing solid organ transplantation (SOT) may acquire infections from the transplanted organ. Routine screening for common infections are an established part of the pretransplant evaluation of donors and recipients. Likewise, strategies exist for prophylaxis and surveillance for common donorassociated infections including hepatitis B, CMV and EBV. However, despite advances in diagnostic testing to evaluate the infectious risk of donors, unanticipated transmission of pathogens occurs, particularly when donors are asymptomatic or have subtle or unusual manifestations of a transmissible Infection. Infectious diseases (ID) providers play an integral role in donor and recipient risk assessment and can advise transplant centers on organ utilization and guide evaluation and management of the SOT recipient. Consideration of the donor cause of death and preceding clinical syndromes are important for characterizing the potential risk for recipient infection. This allows a more accurate analysis of the risk: benefit of accepting a life-saving organ and risk of infection. ID providers and transplant teams should work closely with organ procurement organizations (OPOs) to solicit additional donor information when a donor-derived infection is suspected so that reporting can be facilitated to ensure communication with the care-teams of other organ recipients from the same donors. National advisory committees work closely with federal agencies to provide oversight, guide policy development, and assess outcomes to assist with the prevention and management of donor-transmitted disease through organ transplantation. The clinical vignettes in this review highlight some of the complexities in the evaluation of potential donor transmission.",
      "Boceprevir, GC-376, and calpain inhibitors II, XII inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral replication by targeting the viral main protease A novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, also called novel coronavirus 2019 (nCoV-19), started to circulate among humans around December 2019, and it is now widespread as a global pandemic. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus is called COVID-19, which is highly contagious and has an overall mortality rate of 6.96% as of May 4, 2020. There is no vaccine or antiviral available for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we report our discovery of inhibitors targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)). Using the FRET-based enzymatic assay, several inhibitors including boceprevir, GC-376, and calpain inhibitors II, and XII were identified to have potent activity with single-digit to submicromolar IC(50) values in the enzymatic assay. The mechanism of action of the hits was further characterized using enzyme kinetic studies, thermal shift binding assays, and native mass spectrometry. Significantly, four compounds (boceprevir, GC-376, calpain inhibitors II and XII) inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in cell culture with EC(50) values ranging from 0.49 to 3.37 \u03bcM. Notably, boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII represent novel chemotypes that are distinct from known M(pro) inhibitors. A complex crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) with GC-376, determined at 2.15 \u00c5 resolution with three monomers per asymmetric unit, revealed two unique binding configurations, shedding light on the molecular interactions and protein conformational flexibility underlying substrate and inhibitor binding by M(pro). Overall, the compounds identified herein provide promising starting points for the further development of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.",
      "Screening of an FDA-approved compound library identifies four small-molecule inhibitors of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus replication in cell culture. Coronaviruses can cause respiratory and enteric disease in a wide variety of human and animal hosts. The 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first demonstrated the potentially lethal consequences of zoonotic coronavirus infections in humans. In 2012, a similar previously unknown coronavirus emerged, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), thus far causing over 650 laboratory-confirmed infections, with an unexplained steep rise in the number of cases being recorded over recent months. The human MERS fatality rate of \u223c 30% is alarmingly high, even though many deaths were associated with underlying medical conditions. Registered therapeutics for the treatment of coronavirus infections are not available. Moreover, the pace of drug development and registration for human use is generally incompatible with strategies to combat emerging infectious diseases. Therefore, we have screened a library of 348 FDA-approved drugs for anti-MERS-CoV activity in cell culture. If such compounds proved sufficiently potent, their efficacy might be directly assessed in MERS patients. We identified four compounds (chloroquine, chlorpromazine, loperamide, and lopinavir) inhibiting MERS-CoV replication in the low-micromolar range (50% effective concentrations [EC(50)s], 3 to 8 \u03bcM). Moreover, these compounds also inhibit the replication of SARS coronavirus and human coronavirus 229E. Although their protective activity (alone or in combination) remains to be assessed in animal models, our findings may offer a starting point for treatment of patients infected with zoonotic coronaviruses like MERS-CoV. Although they may not necessarily reduce viral replication to very low levels, a moderate viral load reduction may create a window during which to mount a protective immune response.",
      "The anti\u2010HIV drug nelfinavir mesylate (Viracept) is a potent inhibitor of cell fusion caused by the SARSCoV\u20102 spike (S) glycoprotein warranting further evaluation as an antiviral against COVID\u201019 infections Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\u20102 (SARS CoV\u20102) is the causative agent of the coronavirus disease\u20102019 (COVID\u201019) pandemic. Coronaviruses enter cells via fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane and/or via fusion of the viral envelope with endosomal membranes after virion endocytosis. The spike (S) glycoprotein is a major determinant of virus infectivity. Herein, we show that the transient expression of the SARS CoV\u20102 S glycoprotein in Vero cells caused extensive cell fusion (formation of syncytia) in comparison to limited cell fusion caused by the SARS S glycoprotein. Both S glycoproteins were detected intracellularly and on transfected Vero cell surfaces. These results are in agreement with published pathology observations of extensive syncytia formation in lung tissues of patients with COVID\u201019. These results suggest that SARS CoV\u20102 is able to spread from cell\u2010to\u2010cell much more efficiently than SARS effectively avoiding extracellular neutralizing antibodies. A systematic screening of several drugs including cardiac glycosides and kinase inhibitors and inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) entry revealed that only the FDA\u2010approved HIV protease inhibitor, nelfinavir mesylate (Viracept) drastically inhibited S\u2010n\u2010 and S\u2010o\u2010mediated cell fusion with complete inhibition at a 10\u2010\u03bcM concentration. In\u2010silico docking experiments suggested the possibility that nelfinavir may bind inside the S trimer structure, proximal to the S2 amino terminus directly inhibiting S\u2010n\u2010 and S\u2010o\u2010mediated membrane fusion. Also, it is possible that nelfinavir may act to inhibit S proteolytic processing within cells. These results warrant further investigations of the potential of nelfinavir mesylate to inhibit virus spread at early times after SARS CoV\u20102 symptoms appear.",
      "Complete protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-mediated lethal respiratory disease in aged mice by immunization with a mouse-adapted virus lacking E protein. Zoonotic coronaviruses, including the one that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), cause significant morbidity and mortality in humans. No specific therapy for any human coronavirus is available, making vaccine development critical for protection against these viruses. We previously showed that recombinant SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Urbani strain based) lacking envelope (E) protein expression (rU-\u0394E) provided good but not perfect protection in young mice against challenge with virulent mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15). To improve vaccine efficacy, we developed a second set of E-deleted vaccine candidates on an MA15 background (rMA15-\u0394E). rMA15-\u0394E is safe, causing no disease in 6-week-, 12-month-, or 18-month-old BALB/c mice. Immunization with this virus completely protected mice of three ages from lethal disease and effected more-rapid virus clearance. Compared to rU-\u0394E, rMA15-\u0394E immunization resulted in significantly greater neutralizing antibody and SARS-CoV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses. After challenge, inflammatory cell infiltration, edema, and lung destruction were decreased in the lungs of rMA15-\u0394E-immunized mice compared to those in rU-\u0394E-immunized 12-month-old mice. Collectively, these results show that immunization with a species-adapted attenuated coronavirus lacking E protein expression is safe and provides optimal immunogenicity and long-term protection against challenge with lethal virus. This approach will be generally useful for development of vaccines protective against human coronaviruses as well as against coronaviruses that cause disease in domestic and companion animals.",
      "Downgrading disease transmission risk estimates using terminal importations As emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases like dengue, Ebola, chikungunya, and Zika threaten new populations worldwide, officials scramble to assess local severity and transmissibility, with little to no epidemiological history to draw upon. Standard methods for assessing autochthonous (local) transmission risk make either indirect estimates based on ecological suitability or direct estimates only after local cases accumulate. However, an overlooked source of epidemiological data that can meaningfully inform risk assessments prior to outbreak emergence is the absence of transmission by imported cases. Here, we present a method for updating a priori ecological estimates of transmission risk using real-time importation data. We demonstrate our method using Zika importation and transmission data from Texas in 2016, a high-risk region in the southern United States. Our updated risk estimates are lower than previously reported, with only six counties in Texas likely to sustain a Zika epidemic, and consistent with the number of autochthonous cases detected in 2017. Importation events can thereby provide critical, early insight into local transmission risks as infectious diseases expand their global reach.",
      "Molecular Basis for ADP-ribose Binding to the Macro-X Domain of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp3 The virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, has a large RNA genome that encodes numerous proteins that might be targets for antiviral drugs. Some of these proteins, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymers, helicase and main protease, are well conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and the original SARS virus, but several others are not. This study examines one of the proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 that is most different, a macrodomain of nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3). Although 26% of the amino acids in this SARS-CoV-2 macrodomain differ from those seen in other coronaviruses, biochemical and structural data reveal that the protein retains the ability to bind ADP-ribose, which is an important characteristic of beta coronaviruses, and potential therapeutic target.",
      "Neural reflex pathways in intestinal inflammation: hypotheses to viable therapy. Studies in neuroscience and immunology have clarified much of the anatomical and cellular basis for bidirectional interactions between the nervous and immune systems. As with other organs, intestinal immune responses and the development of immunity seems to be modulated by neural reflexes. Sympathetic immune modulation and reflexes are well described, and in the past decade the parasympathetic efferent vagus nerve has been added to this immune-regulation network. This system, designated 'the inflammatory reflex', comprises an afferent arm that senses inflammation and an efferent arm that inhibits innate immune responses. Intervention in this system as an innovative principle is currently being tested in pioneering trials of vagus nerve stimulation using implantable devices to treat IBD. Patients benefit from this treatment, but some of the working mechanisms remain to be established, for instance, treatment is effective despite the vagus nerve not always directly innervating the inflamed tissue. In this Review, we will focus on the direct neuronal regulatory mechanisms of immunity in the intestine, taking into account current advances regarding the innervation of the spleen and lymphoid organs, with a focus on the potential for treatment in IBD and other gastrointestinal pathologies.",

This review summarizes progress made in the area of enteric viral infections including its applicability to human disease.",
      "Differentially expressed non-coding RNAs induced by transmissible gastroenteritis virus potentially regulate inflammation and NF-\u03baB pathway in porcine intestinal epithelial cell line BACKGROUND: Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection can activate NF-\u03baB pathway in porcine intestinal epithelial cells and result in severe inflammation. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are not translated into proteins and play an important role in many biological and pathological processes such as inflammation, viral infection, and mitochondrial damage. However, whether ncRNAs participate in TGEV-induced inflammation in porcine intestinal epithelial cells is largely unknown. RESULTS: In this study, the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology was used to analyze the profiles of mRNAs, miRNAs, and circRNAs in Mock- and TGEV-infected intestinal porcine epithelial cell-jejunum 2 (IPEC-J2) cell line. A total of 523 mRNAs, 65 microRNAs (miRNAs), and 123 circular RNAs (circRNAs) were differentially expressed. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed differentially expressed mRNAs were linked to inflammation-related pathways, including NF-\u03baB, Toll-like receptor, NOD-like receptor, Jak-STAT, TNF, and RIG-I-like receptor pathways. The interactions among mRNA, miRNA, and circRNA were analyzed. The data showed that ssc_circ_009380 and miR-22 might have interaction relationship. Dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-22 directly bound to ssc_circ_009380. We also observed that overexpression of miR-22 led to a reduction of p-I\u03baB-\u03b1 and accumulation of p65 in nucleus in TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells. In contrast, inhibition of miR-22 had the opposite effects. Moreover, silencing of ssc_circ_009380 inhibited accumulation of p65 in nucleus and phosphorylation of I\u03baB-\u03b1. CONCLUSIONS: The data revealed that differentially expressed mRNAs and ncRNAs were primarily enriched in inflammation-related pathways and ssc_circ_009380 promoted activation of NF-\u03baB pathway by binding miR-22 during TGEV-induced inflammation.

      "High SARS-CoV-2 Attack Rate Following Exposure at a Choir Practice - Skagit County, Washington, March 2020. On March 17, 2020, a member of a Skagit County, Washington, choir informed Skagit County Public Health (SCPH) that several members of the 122-member choir had become ill. Three persons, two from Skagit County and one from another area, had test results positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Another 25 persons had compatible symptoms. SCPH obtained the choir's member list and began an investigation on March 18. Among 61 persons who attended a March 10 choir practice at which one person was known to be symptomatic, 53 cases were identified, including 33 confirmed and 20 probable cases (secondary attack rates of 53.3% among confirmed cases and 86.7% among all cases). Three of the 53 persons who became ill were hospitalized (5.7%), and two died (3.7%). The 2.5-hour singing practice provided several opportunities for droplet and fomite transmission, including members sitting close to one another, sharing snacks, and stacking chairs at the end of the practice. The act of singing, itself, might have contributed to transmission through emission of aerosols, which is affected by loudness of vocalization (1). Certain persons, known as superemitters, who release more aerosol particles during speech than do their peers, might have contributed to this and previously reported COVID-19 superspreading events (2-5). These data demonstrate the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and the possibility of superemitters contributing to broad transmission in certain unique activities and circumstances. It is recommended that persons avoid face-to-face contact with others, not gather in groups, avoid crowded places, maintain physical distancing of at least 6 feet to reduce transmission, and wear cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.",
      "The Combination of Tocilizumab and Methylprednisolone Along With Initial Lung Recruitment Strategy in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients Requiring Mechanical Ventilation: A Series of 21 Consecutive Cases OBJECTIVE: To describe the outcomes with use of a combination of tocilizumab and methylprednisolone administered around the time of endotracheal intubation in patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019-associated hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. DATA SOURCES: Retrospective chart review. STUDY SELECTION/DATA EXTRACTION: Twenty-one consecutive patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019-associated hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Initial ventilator parameters were positive end-expiratory pressure 14 cm H(2)o and target plateau pressure 29 cm H(2)o to maximize lung recruitment. Methylprednisolone (125 mg every 6hr for 24 hr with tapering to 60 mg every 12 hr) was administered shortly after patients were intubated (median 11 hr after intubation). DATA SYNTHESIS: No patient in the cohort died while hospitalized (mortality, 0%; 95% CI, 0%\u201318%) and 18 patients have been discharged from the acute care setting. Twenty of 21 patients (95%) have been liberated from mechanical ventilation after a median duration of 8 days (range, 4\u201330 d). Following 48 hours of methylprednisolone, the A-a o(2) gradient decreased from 455 \u00b1 103 to 228 \u00b1 109 mm Hg (difference 227 \u00b1 108 mm Hg; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our positive experience with tocilizumab in combination with methylprednisolone started early after endotracheal intubation may be one avenue for reducing the morbidity and mortality seen with severe coronavirus disease 2019 and merits further exploration in clinical studies.",

Leaf Extract Attenuates Lung Inflammation in Mice with Acute Lung Injury The hydroalcoholic extract of Punica granatum (pomegranate) leaves was previously demonstrated to be anti-inflammatory in a rat model of lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced acute peritonitis. Here, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of the ethyl acetate fraction obtained from the pomegranate leaf hydroalcoholic extract (EAFPg) on the LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI) mouse model. Male Swiss mice received either EAFPg at different doses or dexamethasone (per os) prior to LPS intranasal instillation. Vehicle-treated mice were used as controls. Animals were culled at 4 h after LPS challenge, and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung samples were collected for analysis. EAFPg and kaempferol effects on NO and cytokine production by LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages were also investigated. Pretreatment with EAFPg (100\u2013300 mg/kg) markedly reduced cell accumulation (specially neutrophils) and collagen deposition in the lungs of ALI mice. The same animals presented with reduced lung and BALF TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 expression in comparison with vehicle controls (p < 0.05). Additionally, incubation with either EAFPg or kaempferol (100 \u03bcg/ml) reduced NO production and cytokine gene expression in cultured LPS-treated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Overall, these results demonstrate that the prophylactic treatment with EAFPg attenuates acute lung inflammation. We suggest this fraction may be useful in treating ALI.",

      "Systematic and Statistical Review of Coronavirus Disease 19 Treatment Trials The following systematic review and meta-analysis compile the current data regarding human controlled COVID-19 treatment trials. An electronic search of the literature compiled studies pertaining to human controlled treatment trials with COVID-19. Medications assessed included lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, favipiravir, heparin, and dexamethasone. Statistical analyses were performed for common viral clearance endpoints whenever possible. Lopinavir/ritonavir showed no significant effect on viral clearance for COVID-19 cases (OR 0.95 [95% CI 0.50\u20131.83]). Hydroxychloroquine also showed no significant effect on COVID-19 viral clearance rates (OR 2.16 [95% CI 0.80\u20135.84]). Arbidol showed no 7-day (OR 1.63 [95% CI 0.76\u20133.50]) or 14-day viral (OR 5.37 [95% CI 0.35\u201383.30]) clearance difference compared to lopinavir/ritonavir. Review of literature showed no significant clinical improvement with lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, hydroxychloroquine, or remdesivir. Tocilizumab showed mixed results regarding survival. Favipiravir showed quicker symptom improvement compared to lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol. Heparin and dexamethasone showed improvement with severe COVID-19 cases requiring supplemental oxygenation. Current medications do not show significant effect on COVID-19 viral clearance rates. Tocilizumab showed mixed results regarding survival. Favipiravir shows favorable results compared to other tested medications. Heparin and dexamethasone show benefit especially for severe COVID-19 cases.",

      "Discriminating Mild from Critical COVID-19 by Innate and Adaptive Immune Single-cell Profiling of Bronchoalveolar Lavages How innate and adaptive lung immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 synchronize during COVID-19 pneumonitis and regulate disease severity is poorly established. To address this, we applied single-cell profiling to bronchoalveolar lavages from 44 patients with mild or critical COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 pneumonia as control. Viral RNA-tracking delineated the infection phenotype to epithelial cells, but positioned mainly neutrophils at the forefront of viral clearance activity during COVID-19. In mild disease, neutrophils could execute their antiviral function in an immunologically \u2018controlled\u2019 fashion, regulated by fully-differentiated T-helper-17 (TH17)-cells, as well as T-helper-1 (TH1)-cells, CD8+ resident-memory (TRM) and partially-exhausted (TEX) T-cells with good effector functions. This was paralleled by \u2018orderly\u2019 phagocytic disposal of dead/stressed cells by fully-differentiated macrophages, otherwise characterized by anti-inflammatory and antigen-presenting characteristics, hence facilitating lung tissue repair. In critical disease, CD4+ TH1- and CD8+ TEX-cells were characterized by inflammation-associated stress and metabolic exhaustion, while CD4+ TH17- and CD8+ TRM-cells failed to differentiate. Consequently, T-cell effector function was largely impaired thereby possibly facilitating excessive neutrophil-based inflammation. This was accompanied by impaired monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, with monocytes exhibiting an ATP-purinergic signalling-inflammasome footprint, thereby enabling COVID-19 associated fibrosis and worsening disease severity. Our work represents a major resource for understanding the lung-localised immunity and inflammation landscape during COVID-19.",
      "COVID\u201019 and the use of immunomodulatory and biologic agents for severe cutaneous disease: An Australian/New Zealand consensus statement Patients on immunomodulators, including biologic agents and new small molecular inhibitors, for cutaneous disease, represent a potentially vulnerable population during the COVID\u201019 pandemic. There is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether patients on systemic immunomodulators are at increased risk of developing COVID\u201019 disease or more likely to have severe disease. As such, clinicians need to assess the benefit\u2010to\u2010risk ratio on a case\u2010by\u2010case basis. In patients with suspected or confirmed COVID\u201019 disease, all immunomodulators used for skin diseases should be immediately withheld, with the possible exception of systemic corticosteroid therapy, which needs to be weaned. In patients who develop symptoms or signs of an upper respiratory tract infection, but COVID\u201019 is not yet confirmed, consider dose reduction or temporarily cessation for 1\u20132 weeks. In otherwise well patients, immunomodulators and biologics should be continued.

      "Transmission routes of Covid-19 virus in the Diamond Princess Cruise ship Background: An outbreak of COVID-19 occurred on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in January and February 2020. We analysed information about cases to infer transmission dynamics and potential modes of transmission. Methods: We collected the daily number of 197 symptomatic cases, and that of the 146 passenger cases in two categories, i.e. those who stayed and did not stay in the same stateroom. We retrieved the quarantine details and the ship's 14-day itinerary. We searched the websites of national/local health authority along the cruise routes and local news using Google for locally confirmed cases associated with the ship. We obtained the design of air conditioning and sewage treatment of the ship from literature. We back-calculated the dates of infection from the epidemic curve and compared with the start of on-board quarantine. Results: Major infections started on Jan 28 and completed by Feb 6 for passengers except those who stayed in the same stateroom with infected individual(s). No other confirmed cases were identified among the disembarked people in Hong Kong except an 80 years old passenger. No confirmed cases were reported in three other stopovers between Jan 27-31 associated with disembarked passengers or visitors from the ship, however two Okinawa taxi drivers became confirmed cases in association with driving the ship passengers. Infection among passengers after Feb 6 was limited to those who stayed in the same stateroom with an infected passenger. Infections in crew members peaked on Feb 7, suggesting significant transmission among crew members after quarantine on Feb 5. Conclusions: We infer that the ship central air conditioning system did not play a role, i.e. the long-range airborne route was absent in the outbreak. Most transmission appears to have occurred through close contact and fomites.",
      "ACE 2 Coding Variants: A Potential X-linked Risk Factor for COVID-19 Disease Viral genetic variants are widely known to influence disease progression among infected humans. Given the recent and rapid emergence of pandemic SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cause of COVID-19 disease, viral protein variants have attracted research interest. However, little has yet been written about genetic risk factors among human hosts. Human genetic variation has proven to affect disease progression and outcome for important diseases such as HIV infection and malaria infestation. The fact that the human ACE2 protein is encoded on the X chromosome means that males who carry rare ACE2 coding variants will express those variants in all ACE2-expressing cells, whereas females will typically express those variants in a mosaic distribution determined by early X-inactivation events. This sex-based difference in ACE2 expression has unique implications for epidemiological studies designed to assess host genetic factors influencing progression from asymptomatic SARS-coV-2 infection to COVID-19. Here we present theoretical modelling of rare ACE2 coding variants documented to occur naturally in several human superpopulations and subpopulations, and show that rare variants predicted to affect the binding of ACE2 to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein exist in people. Though the rs4646116 (p.Lys26Arg) allele is found in 1 in 70 Ashkenazi Jewish males, and in 1 in 172 non-Finnish European males, this allele is found at higher frequencies in females. Furthermore, the class of missense ACE2 alleles predicted to affect SARS-CoV-2 binding are found in aggregate among 1.43% and 2.16% of Ashkenazi males and females, respectively, as well as in 0.58% and 1.24% of European males and females outside of Finland. These alleles are rarer in other population groups, and almost absent from East Asians genotyped to date. Though we are aware that full genome-wide and exome-wide sequencing studies may ultimately be required to assess human genetic susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 fully, we argue on the basis of strong prior probabilities that genotyping of this class of alleles is justified in cases of atypical SARS-CoV-2 diseases, such as asymptomatic super-spreaders (if any are identified), and in neonatal/paediatric-onset COVID-19 disease. Even relatively rare susceptibility factors (1% or fewer carriers) may become quantitatively important in the context of hundreds of thousands of infections. A small number of asymptomatic carriers, or a small number of super-spreaders, or a small segment of the population that is disproportionately likely to require intensive care, can magnify the medical, social and economic impacts of a pandemic of this size. The speed of the pandemic and the large number of affected cases worldwide justify efforts to identify all possible risk factors for adverse outcomes, including efforts to identify genetic susceptibility factors in human hosts.",

Treatments were: clover hay (Trifolium alexandrinum), palm fronds only and palm fronds plus fibrolytic enzymes (enzymes were mixed with palm fronds in rate of 4 g kg-1 of dry matter (DM). The results showed a reduction (p < 0.05) in gas production, ammoniac nitrogen (NH3-N, DM and organic matter (OM) digestibility in palm fronds compared with clover hay. While supplementing palm fronds with fibrolytic enzymes improved DM and OM digestibility compared with palm fronds only without (p < 0.05) differences with clover hay. Also, supplementing palm fronds with fibrolytic enzymes reduced (p < 0.05) gas production compared with other treatments. It could be concluded that adding fibrolytic enzymes improved the utilization of palm fronds as alternative roughage without negative effect on nutrients digestibility and reduced gas production which improve the environmental aspects of feeding ruminant animals.(AU)",
      "From COVID-19 research to vaccine application: why might it take 17 months not 17 years and what are the wider lessons? It is often said that it takes 17 years to move medical research from bench to bedside. In a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) world, such time-lags feel intolerable. In these extraordinary circumstances could years be made into months? If so, could those lessons be used to accelerate medical research when the crisis eases? To measure time-lags in health and biomedical research as well as to identify ways of reducing them, we developed and published (in 2015) a matrix consisting of overlapping tracks (or stages/phases) in the translation from discovery research to developed products, policies and practice. The matrix aids analysis by highlighting the time and actions required to develop research (and its translation) both (1) along each track and (2) from one track to another, e.g. from the discovery track to the research-in-humans track. We noted four main approaches to reducing time-lags, namely increasing resources, working in parallel, starting or working at risk, and improving processes. Examining these approaches alongside the matrix helps interpret the enormous global effort to develop a vaccine for the 2019 novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Rapid progress in the discovery/basic and human research tracks is being made through a combination of large-scale funding, work being conducted in parallel (between different teams globally and through working in overlapping tracks), working at greater (but proportionate) risk to safety than usual, and adopting various new processes. The overlapping work of some of the teams involves continuing animal research whilst entering vaccine candidates into Phase I trials alongside planning their Phase II trials. The additional funding available helps to reduce some of the usual financial risks in moving so quickly. Going forward through the increasingly large human trials for safety, dosage and efficacy, it will be vital to overlap work in parallel in the often challenging public policy and clinical tracks. Thus, regulatory and reimbursement bodies are beginning and preparing rapid action to pull vaccines proving to be safe and effective through to extraordinarily rapid application to the general population. Monitoring the development of a COVID-19 vaccine using the matrix (modified as necessary) could help identify which of the approaches speeding development and deployment could be usefully applied more widely in the future.",

      "Zn(2+) Inhibits Coronavirus and Arterivirus RNA Polymerase Activity In Vitro and Zinc Ionophores Block the Replication of These Viruses in Cell Culture Increasing the intracellular Zn(2+) concentration with zinc-ionophores like pyrithione (PT) can efficiently impair the replication of a variety of RNA viruses, including poliovirus and influenza virus. For some viruses this effect has been attributed to interference with viral polyprotein processing. In this study we demonstrate that the combination of Zn(2+) and PT at low concentrations (2 \u00b5M Zn(2+) and 2 \u00b5M PT) inhibits the replication of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and equine arteritis virus (EAV) in cell culture. The RNA synthesis of these two distantly related nidoviruses is catalyzed by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is the core enzyme of their multiprotein replication and transcription complex (RTC). Using an activity assay for RTCs isolated from cells infected with SARS-CoV or EAV\u2014thus eliminating the need for PT to transport Zn(2+) across the plasma membrane\u2014we show that Zn(2+) efficiently inhibits the RNA-synthesizing activity of the RTCs of both viruses. Enzymatic studies using recombinant RdRps (SARS-CoV nsp12 and EAV nsp9) purified from E. coli subsequently revealed that Zn(2+) directly inhibited the in vitro activity of both nidovirus polymerases. More specifically, Zn(2+) was found to block the initiation step of EAV RNA synthesis, whereas in the case of the SARS-CoV RdRp elongation was inhibited and template binding reduced. By chelating Zn(2+) with MgEDTA, the inhibitory effect of the divalent cation could be reversed, which provides a novel experimental tool for in vitro studies of the molecular details of nidovirus replication and transcription.",

      "Increased Detection coupled with Social Distancing and Health Capacity Planning Reduce the Burden of COVID-19 Cases and Fatalities: A Proof of Concept Study using a Stochastic Computational Simulation Model Objective: In absence of any vaccine, the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is being contained through a non-pharmaceutical measure termed Social Distancing (SD). However, whether SD alone is enough to flatten the epidemic curve is debatable. Using a Stochastic Computational Simulation Model, we investigated the impact of increasing SD, hospital beds and COVID-19 detection rates in preventing COVID-19 cases and fatalities. Research Design and Methods: The Stochastic Simulation Model was built using the EpiModel package in R. As a proof of concept study, we ran the simulation on Kasaragod, the most affected district in Kerala. We added 3 compartments to the SEIR model to obtain a SEIQHRF (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Quarantined-Hospitalised-Recovered-Fatal) model. Results: Implementing SD only delayed the appearance of peak prevalence of COVID-19 cases. Doubling of hospital beds could not reduce the fatal cases probably due to its overwhelming number compared to the hospital beds. Increasing detection rates could significantly flatten the curve and reduce the peak prevalence of cases (increasing detection rate by 5 times could reduce case number to half). Conclusions: An effective strategy to contain the epidemic spread of COVID-19 in India is to increase detection rates in combination with SD measures and increase in hospital beds.",
      "Transmission of Respiratory Infectious Diseases between Neighboring Cities using Agent-based Model and Compartmental Model We formulate an agent-based model and a compartmental model (SEIR) that simulate the spread of a respiratory infectious disease between two neighboring cities. We consider preventive measures such as implementation of social distancing and lockdown in a city, as well as the effect of protective gears or practices. The chance of travelling to another city and within the city during lockdown, and initial percentage of exposed and infected individuals on both cities influence the increase in the number of newly-infected individuals on both models. Our simulations show that (i) increase in exposed individuals results in increase in number of new infections, hence the need for increased testing-isolation efforts; (ii) protection level of 75-100% effectiveness impedes disease transmission; (iii) travelling within city or to other city can be an option given that strict preventive measures (e.g., non-pharmaceutical interventions) are observed; and (iv) the ideal set-up for neighboring cities is to implement lockdown when there is high risk of disease local transmission while individuals observe social distancing, maximizing protective measures, and isolating those that are exposed. The results of the agent-based and compartmental models show similar qualitative dynamics; the differences are due to different spatio-temporal heterogeneity and stochasticity. These models can aid decision makers in designing infectious disease-related policies to protect individuals while continuing population movement.",
      "The effect of control strategies to reduce social mixing on outcomes of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China: a modelling study BACKGROUND: In December, 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus, emerged in Wuhan, China. Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures in response to the outbreak, including extended school and workplace closures. We aimed to estimate the effects of physical distancing measures on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, hoping to provide some insights for the rest of the world. METHODS: To examine how changes in population mixing have affected outbreak progression in Wuhan, we used synthetic location-specific contact patterns in Wuhan and adapted these in the presence of school closures, extended workplace closures, and a reduction in mixing in the general community. Using these matrices and the latest estimates of the epidemiological parameters of the Wuhan outbreak, we simulated the ongoing trajectory of an outbreak in Wuhan using an age-structured susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model for several physical distancing measures. We fitted the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in an age-structured epidemic framework and investigated the age distribution of cases. We also simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak (at the beginning of March or April). FINDINGS: Our projections show that physical distancing measures were most effective if the staggered return to work was at the beginning of April; this reduced the median number of infections by more than 92% (IQR 66-97) and 24% (13-90) in mid-2020 and end-2020, respectively. There are benefits to sustaining these measures until April in terms of delaying and reducing the height of the peak, median epidemic size at end-2020, and affording health-care systems more time to expand and respond. However, the modelled effects of physical distancing measures vary by the duration of infectiousness and the role school children have in the epidemic. INTERPRETATION: Restrictions on activities in Wuhan, if maintained until April, would probably help to delay the epidemic peak. Our projections suggest that premature and sudden lifting of interventions could lead to an earlier secondary peak, which could be flattened by relaxing the interventions gradually. However, there are limitations to our analysis, including large uncertainties around estimates of R0 and the duration of infectiousness.

      "Evaluating the effectiveness of social distancing interventions against COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 140,000 people as of March 14, 2020. We use a mathematical model to investigate the effectiveness of social distancing interventions lasting six weeks in a middle-sized city in the US. We explore four social distancing strategies by reducing the contacts of adults over 60 years old, adults over 60 years old and children, all adults (25, 75 or 95% compliance), and everyone in the population. Our results suggest that social distancing interventions can avert cases by 20% and hospitalizations and deaths by 90% even with modest compliance within adults as long as the intervention is kept in place, but the epidemic is set to rebound once the intervention is lifted. Our models suggest that social distancing interventions will buy crucial time but need to occur in conjunction with testing and contact tracing of all suspected cases to mitigate transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",
      "Modeling the dynamics of COVID19 spread during and after social distancing Non-pharmaceutical intervention measures, such as social distancing, have so far been the only means to slow the spread of COVID19. In the United States, strict social distancing has resulted in different types infection dynamics. In some states, such as New York, extensive infection spread was followed by a pronounced decline of infection levels. In other states, such as California, less infection spread occurred before strict social distancing, and a different pattern was observed. Instead of a pronounced infection decline, a long-lasting plateau is evident, characterized by similar daily new infection levels. While these plateau dynamics cannot be readily reproduced with standard SIR infection models, we show that network models, in which individuals and their social contacts are explicitly tracked, can reproduce the plateau if network connections are cut due to social distancing measures. The reason is that in networks characterized by a degree of 2D spatial structure, infection tends to spread quadratically with time, but as edges are randomly removed, the infection spreads along nearly one-dimensional infection \"corridors\", resulting in plateau dynamics. Interestingly, the plateau dynamics are predicted to eventually transition into an infection decline phase without any further increase in social distancing measures. Additionally, the models suggest that a potential second wave becomes significantly less pronounced if social distancing is only relaxed once the dynamics have transitioned to the decline phase. The network models analyzed here allow us to interpret and reconcile different infection dynamics during social distancing observed in various US states.",
      "Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on URIs and influenza in crowded, urban households. OBJECTIVES We compared the impact of three household interventions-education, education with alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and education with hand sanitizer and face masks-on incidence and secondary transmission of upper respiratory infections (URIs) and influenza, knowledge of transmission of URIs, and vaccination rates. METHODS A total of 509 primarily Hispanic households participated. Participants reported symptoms twice weekly, and nasal swabs were collected from those with an influenza-like illness (ILI). Households were followed for up to 19 months and home visits were made at least every two months. RESULTS We recorded 5034 URIs, of which 669 cases reported ILIs and 78 were laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza. Demographic factors significantly associated with infection rates included age, gender, birth location, education, and employment. The Hand Sanitizer group was significantly more likely to report that no household member had symptoms (p < 0.01), but there were no significant differences in rates of infection by intervention group in multivariate analyses. Knowledge improved significantly more in the Hand Sanitizer group (p < 0.0001). The proportion of households that reported > or = 50% of members receiving influenza vaccine increased during the study (p < 0.001). Despite the fact that compliance with mask wearing was poor, mask wearing as well as increased crowding, lower education levels of caretakers, and index cases 0-5 years of age (compared with adults) were associated with significantly lower secondary transmission rates (all p < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS In this population, there was no detectable additional benefit of hand sanitizer or face masks over targeted education on overall rates of URIs, but mask wearing was associated with reduced secondary transmission and should be encouraged during outbreak situations. During the study period, community concern about methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was occurring, perhaps contributing to the use of hand sanitizer in the Education control group, and diluting the intervention's measurable impact."

      "COVID-19: Review of Epidemiology and Potential Treatments Against 2019 Novel Coronavirus An epidemic of extreme respiratory deterrence, pneumonia and shortness of breath, the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, and rapidly spread across China and beyond, with human to human transmission. On February 12, 2020, World Health Organization officially named the new coronavirus disease as coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). Most COVID-19 patients were diagnosed with pneumonia and many were treated using Chinese medicines and other secondary therapies. As of April 22, 2020, the total figure of infected patients has crossed 2.6 million people worldwide with over 180,000 deaths and 700,000 patients that have recovered. Preliminary reports suggest that certain drugs, such as chloroquine and antiviral nucleotide analogues such as remdesivir, which inhibit viral replication, can target the new coronavirus, although their usefulness in the clinic is still under debate. An expert US committee developed the US NIH guidelines for COVID-19 treatment, which was just released and will be regularly updated. This manuscript reviews the epidemiology, etiology, mortality, COVID-19 clinical symptoms, and potential therapeutic drugs, while highlighting the seriousness and damage-induced by SARS-CoV-2.",
      "Modelling SARS-CoV-2 Dynamics: Implications for Therapy The scientific community is focussed on developing antiviral therapies to mitigate the impacts of the ongoing novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. This will be facilitated by improved understanding of viral dynamics within infected hosts. Here, using a mathematical model in combination with published viral load data collected from the same specimen (throat / nasal swabs or nasopharyngeal / sputum / tracheal aspirate), we compare within-host dynamics for patients infected in the current outbreak with analogous dynamics for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections. Our quantitative analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics are more severe than those for mild cases of MERS-CoV, but are similar to severe cases, and that the viral dynamics of SARS-CoV infection are similar to those of MERS-CoV in mild cases but not in severe case. Consequently, SARS-CoV-2 generates infection dynamics that are more severe than SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we used our viral dynamics model to predict the effectiveness of unlicensed drugs that have different methods of action. The effectiveness was measured by AUC of viral load. Our results indicated that therapies that block de novo infections or virus production are most likely to be effective if initiated before the peak viral load (which occurs around three days after symptom onset on average), but therapies that promote cytotoxicity are likely to have only limited effects. Our unique mathematical approach provides insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, which are useful for development of antiviral therapies.",

There was moderate to strong correlation between the qualitative and quantitative data. Bone density, BV and BM showed strong correlations within this dataset (BD-BV, r = 0.814; BD-BM, r = 0.818; BV-BM, r = 1.000). Likewise, optical density measures were strongly correlated with BD (r = 0.824), BV (r = 0.957) and BM (r = 0.959). The utilization of both qualitative and quantitative data, in assessment of the progression of fracture healing, has provided valuable insight. Measures of optical density have been shown to make a substantial contribution to this assessment and which should be considered for use in studies evaluating fracture healing.",

      "An Update on Current Therapeutic Drugs Treating COVID-19 The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has presented unprecedented challenges to the healthcare systems in almost every country around the world. Currently, there are no proven effective vaccines or therapeutic agents against the virus. Current clinical management includes infection prevention and control measures and supportive care including supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilatory support. Evolving research and clinical data regarding the virologic SARS-CoV-2 suggest a potential list of repurposed drugs with appropriate pharmacological effects and therapeutic efficacies in treating COVID-19 patients. In this review, we will update and summarize the most common and plausible drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. These drugs and therapeutic agents include antiviral agents (remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir, umifenovir, favipiravir, and oseltamivir), and supporting agents (Ascorbic acid, Azithromycin, Corticosteroids, Nitric oxide, IL-6 antagonists), among others. We hope that this review will provide useful and most updated therapeutic drugs to prevent, control, and treat COVID-19 patients until the approval of vaccines and specific drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2.",
      "Effectiveness of a nosocomial infection control training in improving knowledge in patient-hired attendants and outsourced workers in Taiwan. Nosocomial infection represents an important indicator of healthcare quality and patient safety. Based on the experience gained during the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Taiwan in 2003, we gained greater awareness of the potential threat from patient-hired attendants and outsourced workers as bacteria carriers and transmitters. This study built a training model and evaluated training effectiveness in terms of improved knowledge. The training model included nosocomial infection control guidelines, a training CD, training program, evaluation form, and descriptive procedures for conducting training and evaluation. The training course for this study was conducted in 17 hospitals in Taiwan, with a total of 1,467 participants attending 27 seminars and 1,265 effective samples (return rate = 86.2%). Results of the study showed a statistical difference of < .001 before and after the training course on participant understanding of nosocomial infection control. Advantages of applying this training model include knowledge enhancement and reduced implementation time, manpower input and budget outlay. In addition to greater flexibility, the model can also positively influence clinical practice, improve patient safety and reduce hospital nosocomial infection rates. This program is worth promoting in hospitals and other healthcare institutions.",

      "A Review of SARS-CoV-2 and the Ongoing Clinical Trials The sudden outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, later named SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, which rapidly grew into a global pandemic, marked the third introduction of a virulent coronavirus into the human society, affecting not only the healthcare system, but also the global economy. Although our understanding of coronaviruses has undergone a huge leap after two precedents, the effective approaches to treatment and epidemiological control are still lacking. In this article, we present a succinct overview of the epidemiology, clinical features, and molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. We summarize the current epidemiological and clinical data from the initial Wuhan studies, and emphasize several features of SARS-CoV-2, which differentiate it from SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), such as high variability of disease presentation. We systematize the current clinical trials that have been rapidly initiated after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas the trials on SARS-CoV-2 genome-based specific vaccines and therapeutic antibodies are currently being tested, this solution is more long-term, as they require thorough testing of their safety. On the other hand, the repurposing of the existing therapeutic agents previously designed for other virus infections and pathologies happens to be the only practical approach as a rapid response measure to the emergent pandemic, as most of these agents have already been tested for their safety. These agents can be divided into two broad categories, those that can directly target the virus replication cycle, and those based on immunotherapy approaches either aimed to boost innate antiviral immune responses or alleviate damage induced by dysregulated inflammatory responses. The initial clinical studies revealed the promising therapeutic potential of several of such drugs, including favipiravir, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that interferes with the viral replication, and hydroxychloroquine, the repurposed antimalarial drug that interferes with the virus endosomal entry pathway. We speculate that the current pandemic emergency will be a trigger for more systematic drug repurposing design approaches based on big data analysis."

      "The COVID-19 pandemic and health inequalities This essay examines the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for health inequalities. It outlines historical and contemporary evidence of inequalities in pandemics\u2014drawing on international research into the Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918, the H1N1 outbreak of 2009 and the emerging international estimates of socio-economic, ethnic and geographical inequalities in COVID-19 infection and mortality rates. It then examines how these inequalities in COVID-19 are related to existing inequalities in chronic diseases and the social determinants of health, arguing that we are experiencing a syndemic pandemic. It then explores the potential consequences for health inequalities of the lockdown measures implemented internationally as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the likely unequal impacts of the economic crisis. The essay concludes by reflecting on the longer-term public health policy responses needed to ensure that the COVID-19 pandemic does not increase health inequalities for future generations.",

      "COVID-19: Review of Epidemiology and Potential Treatments Against 2019 Novel Coronavirus An epidemic of extreme respiratory deterrence, pneumonia and shortness of breath, the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, and rapidly spread across China and beyond, with human to human transmission. On February 12, 2020, World Health Organization officially named the new coronavirus disease as coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). Most COVID-19 patients were diagnosed with pneumonia and many were treated using Chinese medicines and other secondary therapies. As of April 22, 2020, the total figure of infected patients has crossed 2.6 million people worldwide with over 180,000 deaths and 700,000 patients that have recovered. Preliminary reports suggest that certain drugs, such as chloroquine and antiviral nucleotide analogues such as remdesivir, which inhibit viral replication, can target the new coronavirus, although their usefulness in the clinic is still under debate. An expert US committee developed the US NIH guidelines for COVID-19 treatment, which was just released and will be regularly updated. This manuscript reviews the epidemiology, etiology, mortality, COVID-19 clinical symptoms, and potential therapeutic drugs, while highlighting the seriousness and damage-induced by SARS-CoV-2.",

      "Azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine for patients admitted to intensive care due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-protocol of randomised controlled trial AZIQUINE-ICU BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is known to be susceptible in vitro to exposure to hydroxychloroquine and its effect has been found to be potentiated by azithromycin. We hypothesise that early administration of hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin can prevent respiratory deterioration in patients admitted to intensive care due to rapidly progressive COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Design: Prospective, multi-centre, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial (RCT). PARTICIPANTS: Adult (> 18 years) within 24 h of admission to the intensive care unit with proven or suspected COVID-19 infection, whether or not mechanically ventilated. Exclusion criteria include duration symptoms of febrile disease for &#8805; 1 week, treatment limitations in place or moribund patients, allergy or intolerance of any study treatment, and pregnancy. INTERVENTIONS: Patients will be randomised in 1:1:1 ratio to receive Hydroxychloroquine 800 mg orally in two doses followed by 400 mg daily in two doses and azithromycin 500 mg orally in one dose followed by 250 mg in one dose for a total of 5 days (HC-A group) or hydroxychloroquine + placebo (HC group) or placebo + placebo (C-group) in addition to the best standard of care, which may evolve during the trial period but will not differ between groups. Primary outcome is the composite percentage of patients alive and not on end-of-life pathway who are free of mechanical ventilation at day 14. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: The percentage of patients who were prevented from needing intubation until day 14, ICU length of stay, and mortality (in hospital) at day 28 and 90. DISCUSSION: Although both investigational drugs are often administered off label to patients with severe COVID-19, at present, there is no data from RCTs on their safety and efficacy. In vitro and observational trial suggests their potential to limit viral replication and the damage to lungs as the most common reason for ICU admission. Therefore, patients most likely to benefit from the treatment are those with severe but early disease. This trial is designed and powered to investigate whether the treatment in this cohort of patients leads to improved clinical patient-centred outcomes, such as mechanical ventilation-free survival. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical trials.gov: NCT04339816 (Registered on 9 April 2020, amended on 22 June 2020); Eudra CT number: 2020-001456-18 (Registered on 29 March 2020).",
      "Boceprevir, GC-376, and calpain inhibitors II, XII inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral replication by targeting the viral main protease A novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, also called novel coronavirus 2019 (nCoV-19), started to circulate among humans around December 2019, and it is now widespread as a global pandemic. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus is called COVID-19, which is highly contagious and has an overall mortality rate of 6.96% as of May 4, 2020. There is no vaccine or antiviral available for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we report our discovery of inhibitors targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)). Using the FRET-based enzymatic assay, several inhibitors including boceprevir, GC-376, and calpain inhibitors II, and XII were identified to have potent activity with single-digit to submicromolar IC(50) values in the enzymatic assay. The mechanism of action of the hits was further characterized using enzyme kinetic studies, thermal shift binding assays, and native mass spectrometry. Significantly, four compounds (boceprevir, GC-376, calpain inhibitors II and XII) inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in cell culture with EC(50) values ranging from 0.49 to 3.37 \u03bcM. Notably, boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII represent novel chemotypes that are distinct from known M(pro) inhibitors. A complex crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) with GC-376, determined at 2.15 \u00c5 resolution with three monomers per asymmetric unit, revealed two unique binding configurations, shedding light on the molecular interactions and protein conformational flexibility underlying substrate and inhibitor binding by M(pro). Overall, the compounds identified herein provide promising starting points for the further development of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.",
      "Olfaction and anosmia in rhinosinusitis Olfactory disorders can cause serious consequences from the inability to detect many olfactory warning signals (eg, smoke, spoiled food, and gas leaks) and can significantly impact nutritional status, eating satisfaction, and many other issues related to quality of life. More than 200,000 people a year seek treatment for impaired olfactory ability, and available evidence suggests this figure is a significant underestimate of those affected. Rhinitis and rhinosinusitis are the primary etiologies for olfactory loss or distortion among patients presenting to chemosensory clinics, and they are among the most common chronic medical conditions in the United States, affecting an estimated 33 million people. Both allergic and nonallergic rhinitis/rhinosinusitis can result in diminished, distorted, or absent olfactory ability. Current therapies are only partially or transiently effective in reversing olfactory loss. The underlying mechanisms by which rhinitis/rhinosinusitis impact olfactory ability are likely to be multifactorial and might include altered air flow and odor deposition, changes in mucus composition, and effects of inflammatory mediators on receptor cell differentiation, maturation, or function.",

PURPOSE Evaluate the efficacy of single-port sleeve gastrectomy (SPSG) and then compare it to a less-invasive sleeve approach (three-port) (3PSG) according to a propensity score (PS) matching analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed all patients who underwent SG through a three-port or a single-port laparoscopic approach. RESULTS After 2 years, the follow-up was completed in 84% patients treated with 3PSG and 95% patients of the SPSG group. Excess weight loss (EWL) was comparable for the first year of follow-up within the two groups except for the controls at 3 months in which the SPSG group showed a higher EWL (p = 0.0243). CONCLUSION We demonstrated the efficacy of SPSG in bariatric surgery even compared to another, less invasive, laparoscopic SG approach (three-port)."

The recent joint statement from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA) and the European Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Therapy (ESRA) recommends neuraxial and peripheral nerve blocks for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) illness. The benefits of regional anesthetic and analgesic techniques on patient outcomes and healthcare systems are evident. Regional techniques are now additionally promoted as a mechanism to reduce aerosolizing procedures. However, caring for patients with COVID-19 illness requires rapid redefinition of risks and benefits-both for patients and practitioners. These should be fully considered within the context of available evidence and expert opinion. In this Daring Discourse, we present two opposing perspectives on adopting the ASRA/ESRA recommendation. Areas of controversy in the literature and opportunities for research to address knowledge gaps are highlighted.

      "A Case of In-flight Transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS): SARS Serology Positive",
      "Analysis of RNA sequences of 3636 SARS-CoV-2 collected from 55 countries reveals selective sweep of one virus type Background & objectives: SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) is evolving with the progression of the pandemic. This study was aimed to investigate the diversity and evolution of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 with progression of the pandemic over time and to identify similarities and differences of viral diversity and evolution across geographical regions (countries). Methods: Publicly available data on type definitions based on whole-genome sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 sampled during December and March 2020 from 3636 infected patients spread over 55 countries were collected. Phylodynamic analyses were performed and the temporal and spatial evolution of the virus was examined. Results: It was found that (i) temporal variation in frequencies of types of the coronavirus was significant; ancestral viruses of type O were replaced by evolved viruses belonging to type A2a; (ii) spatial variation was not significant; with the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the dominant virus was the A2a type virus in every geographical region; (iii) within a geographical region, there was significant micro-level variation in the frequencies of the different viral types, and (iv) the evolved coronavirus of type A2a swept rapidly across all continents. Interpretation & conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 belonging to the A2a type possesses a non-synomymous variant (D614G) that possibly eases the entry of the virus into the lung cells of the host. This may be the reason why the A2a type has an advantage to infect and survive and as a result has rapidly swept all geographical regions. Therefore, large-scale sequencing of coronavirus genomes and, as required, of host genomes should be undertaken in India to identify regional and ethnic variation in viral composition and its interaction with host genomes. Further, careful collection of clinical and immunological data of the host can provide deep learning in relation to infection and transmission of the types of coronavirus genomes.",

      "Dissemination and co-circulation of SARS-CoV2 subclades exhibiting enhanced transmission associated with increased mortality in Western Europe and the United States Mechanisms underlying the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like clinical manifestations leading to deaths in patients who develop COVID-19 remain uncharacterized. While multiple factors could influence these clinical outcomes, we explored if differences in transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV2 variants could contribute to these terminal clinical consequences of COVID-19. We analyzed 34,412 SARS-CoV2 sequences deposited in the Global Initiative for Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) SARS-CoV2 sequence database to determine if regional differences in circulating strain variants correlated with increased mortality in Europe, the United States, and California. We found two subclades descending from the Wuhan HU-1 strain that rapidly became dominant in Western Europe and the United States. These variants contained nonsynonymous nucleotide mutations in the Orf1ab segment encoding RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (C14408T), the spike protein gene (A23403G), and Orf1a (G25563T), which resulted in non-conservative amino acid substitutions P323L, D614G, and Q57H, respectively. In Western Europe, the A23403G-C14408T subclade dominated, while in the US, the A23403G-C14408T-G25563T mutant became the dominant strain in New York and parts of California. The high cumulative frequencies of both subclades showed inconsistent but significant association with high cumulative CFRs in some of the regions. When the frequencies of the subclades were analyzed by their 7-day moving averages across each epidemic, we found co-circulation of both subclades to temporally correlate with peak mortality periods. We postulate that in areas with high numbers of these co-circulating subclades, a person may get serially infected. The second infection may trigger a hyperinflammatory response similar to the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) response, which could explain the ARDS-like manifestations observed in people with co-morbidity, who may not mount sufficient levels of neutralizing antibodies against the first infection. Further studies are necessary but the implication of such a mechanism will need to be considered for all current COVID-19 vaccine designs.",
      "Bayesian Optimization of Risk Measures We consider Bayesian optimization of objective functions of the form $\\rho[ F(x, W) ]$, where $F$ is a black-box expensive-to-evaluate function and $\\rho$ denotes either the VaR or CVaR risk measure, computed with respect to the randomness induced by the environmental random variable $W$. Such problems arise in decision making under uncertainty, such as in portfolio optimization and robust systems design. We propose a family of novel Bayesian optimization algorithms that exploit the structure of the objective function to substantially improve sampling efficiency. Instead of modeling the objective function directly as is typical in Bayesian optimization, these algorithms model $F$ as a Gaussian process, and use the implied posterior on the objective function to decide which points to evaluate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a variety of numerical experiments.",
      "Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA identified in Eastern India: Possible implications for the ongoing outbreak in India and impact on viral structure and host susceptibility. Direct massively parallel sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genome was undertaken from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples of infected individuals in Eastern India. Seven of the isolates belonged to the A2a clade, while one belonged to the B4 clade. Specific mutations, characteristic of the A2a clade, were also detected, which included the P323L in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and D614G in the Spike glycoprotein. Further, our data revealed emergence of novel subclones harbouring nonsynonymous mutations, viz. G1124V in Spike (S) protein, R203K, and G204R in the nucleocapsid (N) protein. The N protein mutations reside in the SR-rich region involved in viral capsid formation and the S protein mutation is in the S2 domain, which is involved in triggering viral fusion with the host cell membrane. Interesting correlation was observed between these mutations and travel or contact history of COVID-19 positive cases. Consequent alterations of miRNA binding and structure were also predicted for these mutations. More importantly, the possible implications of mutation D614G (in SD domain) and G1124V (in S2 subunit) on the structural stability of S protein have also been discussed. Results report for the first time a bird's eye view on the accumulation of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome in Eastern India.",

      "Structure and Dynamics of the HIV-1 Frameshift Element RNA [Image: see text] The HIV-1 ribosomal frameshift element is highly structured, regulates translation of all virally encoded enzymes, and is a promising therapeutic target. The prior model for this motif contains two helices separated by a three-nucleotide bulge. Modifications to this model were suggested by SHAPE chemical probing of an entire HIV-1 RNA genome. Novel features of the SHAPE-directed model include alternate helical conformations and a larger, more complex structure. These structural elements also support the presence of a secondary frameshift site within the frameshift domain. Here, we use oligonucleotide-directed structure perturbation, probing in the presence of formamide, and in-virion experiments to examine these models. Our data support a model in which the frameshift domain is anchored by a stable helix outside the conventional domain. Less stable helices within the domain can switch from the SHAPE-predicted to the two-helix conformation. Translational frameshifting assays with frameshift domain mutants support a functional role for the interactions predicted by and specific to the SHAPE-directed model. These results reveal that the HIV-1 frameshift domain is a complex, dynamic structure and underscore the importance of analyzing folding in the context of full-length RNAs.",
      "Involvement of Cardiovascular System As The Critical Point in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Prognosis and Recovery The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has already caused more than 300,000 deaths worldwide. Several studies have elucidated the central role of cardiovascular complications in the disease course. Herein, we provide a concise review of current knowledge regarding the involvement of cardiovascular system in the pathogenesis and prognosis of COVID-19. We summarize data from 21 studies involving in total more than 21,000 patients from Asia, Europe and the USA indicating that severe disease is associated with the presence of myocardial injury, heart failure and arrhythmias. Additionally, we present the clinical and laboratory differences between recovered and deceased patients highlighting the importance of cardiac manifestations. For the infected patients, underlying cardiovascular comorbidities and especially existing cardiovascular disease seem to predispose to the development of cardiovascular complications, which are in turn associated with higher mortality rates. We provide mechanistic insights into the underlying mechanisms including direct myocardial damage by the virus and the consequences of the hyperinflammatory syndrome developed later in the disease course. Finally, we summarize current knowledge on therapeutic modalities and recommendations by scientific societies and experts regarding the cardiovascular management of COVID-19 patients.",

      "Driving pressure during proportional assist ventilation: an observational study. BACKGROUND During passive mechanical ventilation, the driving pressure of the respiratory system is an important mediator of ventilator-induced lung injury. Monitoring of driving pressure during assisted ventilation, similar to controlled ventilation, could be a tool to identify patients at risk of ventilator-induced lung injury. The aim of this study was to describe driving pressure over time and to identify whether and when high driving pressure occurs in critically ill patients during assisted ventilation. METHODS Sixty-two patients fulfilling criteria for assisted ventilation were prospectively studied. Patients were included when the treating physician selected proportional assist ventilation (PAV+), a mode that estimates respiratory system compliance. In these patients, continuous recordings of all ventilator parameters were obtained for up to 72 h. Driving pressure was calculated as tidal volume-to-respiratory system compliance ratio. The distribution of driving pressure and tidal volume values over time was examined, and periods of sustained high driving pressure (\u2265 15 cmH2O) and of stable compliance were identified and analyzed. RESULTS The analysis included 3200 h of ventilation, consisting of 8.8 million samples. For most (95%) of the time, driving pressure was < 15 cmH2O and tidal volume < 11 mL/kg (of ideal body weight). In most patients, high driving pressure was observed for short periods of time (median 2.5 min). Prolonged periods of high driving pressure were observed in five patients (8%). During the 661 periods of stable compliance, high driving pressure combined with a tidal volume \u2265 8 mL/kg was observed only in 11 cases (1.6%) pertaining to four patients. High driving pressure occurred almost exclusively when respiratory system compliance was low, and compliance above 30 mL/cmH2O excluded the presence of high driving pressure with 90% sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS In critically ill patients fulfilling criteria for assisted ventilation, and ventilated in PAV+ mode, sustained high driving pressure occurred in a small, yet not negligible number of patients. The presence of sustained high driving pressure was not associated with high tidal volume, but occurred almost exclusively when compliance was below 30 mL/cmH2O.",
      "Cardiac involvement in COVID-19 patients: Risk factors, predictors, and complications: A review BACKGROUND: Respiratory complications have been well remarked in the novel coronavirus disease (SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19), yet an emerging body of research indicates that cardiac involvement may be implicated in poor outcomes for these patients. AIMS: This review seeks to gather and distill the existing body of literature that describes the cardiac implications of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The English literature was reviewed for papers dealing with the cardiac effects of COVID-19. RESULTS: Notably, COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease are counted in greater frequency in intensive care unit settings, and ultimately suffer greater rates of mortality. Other studies have noted cardiac presentations for COVID-19, rather than respiratory, such as acute pericarditis and left ventricular dysfunction. In some patients there has been evidence of acute myocardial injury, with correspondingly increased serum troponin I levels. With regard to surgical interventions, there is a dearth of data describing myocardial protection during cardiac surgery for COVID-19 patients. Although some insights have been garnered in the study of cardiovascular diseases for these patients, these insights remain fragmented and have yet to cement clear guidelines for actionable clinical practice. CONCLUSION: While some information is available, further studies are imperative for a more cohesive understanding of the cardiac pathophysiology in COVID-19 patients to promote more informed treatment and, ultimately, better clinical outcomes.",
      "DCD for Islet Transplantation Pancreatic islet transplantation has the potential to become the most physiologically advantageous and minimally invasive procedure for the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Since the first clinical islet transplantation was performed at the University of Minnesota in 1974 [1], the results have been far from ideal for more than two decades in spite of an improvement of islet isolation technique by Ricordi et al. [2\u20134]. The introduction of the Edmonton protocol, with a highly improved rate of insulin independency, encouraged us to promote clinical islet transplantation [5, 6]. In Japan, we organized the Working Group (The Japanese Islet Transplant Registry) in 1997 under the Japanese Society for Pancreas and Islet Transplantation for the purpose of starting clinical islet transplantation. The first issue of the Working Group was to construct a system of clinical islet transplantation in Japan including the registration of the recipients, procurement of the pancreas for islet isolation and transplantation of the isolated islets. In Japan, afterwards, various problems facing to a start of clinical islet transplantation have been discussed and we completed the guideline for clinical islet transplantation in Japan. The Japanese Organ Transplant Law was enforced in 1997 and organ transplantations using brain dead (DBD) donors were finally started. Since the islet transplantation was not included in the Japanese Organ Transplant Law because it was categorized as tissue transplantation, we were able to use the pancreas only from DCD donors for islet transplantation. The first islet isolation from the human pancreas was performed in 2003.9 and the first islet transplantation was performed in 2004.4 [7\u20139]. Sixty-five islet isolations and 34 islet transplantations were performed in our country from 2003.9.12 to 2007.3.11 [10]. In this chapter, we describe the current status of clinical islet transplantation using DCD donors in Japan.",
      "The Role of Scientific Collections in Scientific Preparedness Building on the findings and recommendations of the Interagency Working Group on Scientific Collections, Scientific Collections International (SciColl) aims to improve the rapid access to science collections across disciplines within the federal government and globally, between government agencies and private research institutions. SciColl offered a novel opportunity for the US Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, to explore the value of scientific research collections under the science preparedness initiative and integrate it as a research resource at each stage in the emergence of the infectious diseases cycle. Under the leadership of SciColl\u2019s executive secretariat at the Smithsonian Institution, and with multiple federal and international partners, a workshop during October 2014 fully explored the intersections of the infectious disease cycle and the role scientific collections could play as an evidentiary scientific resource to mitigate risks associated with emerging infectious diseases.",
      "Cardiovascular Safety of Potential Drugs for the Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic. It is still uncontrolled in most countries and no therapies are currently available. Various drugs are under investigation for its treatment. The disease is known to have worse outcomes in patients who have underlying cardiovascular disease. Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir and lopinavir/ritonavir are currently being studied in trials and show some promise. Conduction disorders, heart failure and mortality have been reported with the use of these drugs. It is important to have a knowledge of potential cardiotoxic effects of these drugs before using them for COVID-19 patients for better allocation of healthcare resources and improvement in clinical outcomes.",

      "The SARS, MERS and novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemics, the newest and biggest global health threats: what lessons have we learned? OBJECTIVES: To provide an overview of the three major deadly coronaviruses and identify areas for improvement of future preparedness plans, as well as provide a critical assessment of the risk factors and actionable items for stopping their spread, utilizing lessons learned from the first two deadly coronavirus outbreaks, as well as initial reports from the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic in Wuhan, China. METHODS: Utilizing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA) website, and a comprehensive review of PubMed literature, we obtained information regarding clinical signs and symptoms, treatment and diagnosis, transmission methods, protection methods and risk factors for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19. Comparisons between the viruses were made. RESULTS: Inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation, and limited reporting on the virus within China has, in part, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout mainland China and into proximal and distant countries. Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due in part to increased globalization and the focus of the epidemic. Wuhan, China is a large hub connecting the North, South, East and West of China via railways and a major international airport. The availability of connecting flights, the timing of the outbreak during the Chinese (Lunar) New Year, and the massive rail transit hub located in Wuhan has enabled the virus to perforate throughout China, and eventually, globally. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that we did not learn from the two prior epidemics of coronavirus and were ill-prepared to deal with the challenges the COVID-19 epidemic has posed. Future research should attempt to address the uses and implications of internet of things (IoT) technologies for mapping the spread of infection.",
      "An outbreak of COVID\u201019 caused by a new coronavirus: what we know so far",
      "Structure and mechanism of Escherichia coli glutathionylspermidine amidase belonging to the family of cysteine; histidine-dependent amidohydrolases/peptidases. The bifunctional Escherichia coli glutathionylspermidine synthetase/amidase (GspSA) catalyzes both the synthesis and hydrolysis of Gsp. Its amidase domain (GspA), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of Gsp into glutathione and spermidine, plays an important role in redox sensing and protein S-thiolation. To gain insight of the regulation and catalytic mechanism of and further understand the recycling of the Gsp dimer and Gsp-S-protein adducts, we solved two crystal structures of GspA and GspSA both with the C59A mutation and bound with the substrate, Gsp. In both structures, Cys59, His131, and Glu147 form the catalytic triad, which is similar to other cysteine proteases. Comparison of the GspA_Gsp complex and apo GspSA structures indicates that on binding with Gsp, the side chains of Asn149 and Gln58 of the amidase domain are induced to move closer to the carbonyl oxygen of the cleaved amide bond of Gsp, thereby participating in catalysis. In addition, the helix-loop region of GspA, corresponding to the sequence (30)YSSLDPQEYEDDA(42), involves in regulating the substrate binding. Our previous study indicated that the thiol of Cys59 of GspA is only oxidized to sulfenic acid by H(2)O(2). When comparing the active site of GspA with those of other cysteine proteases, we found that limited space and hydrophobicity of the environment around Cys59 play an important role to inhibit its further oxidation. The structural results presented here not only elucidate the catalytic mechanism and regulation of GspA but also help us to design small molecules to inhibit or probe for the activity of GspA.",
      "Comprehensive overview of COVID-19 based on current evidence In December 2019, twenty-seven pneumonia patients with unknown causes originated in South China seafood market in Wuhan. The virus infection spread rapidly and swept through China in less than a month. Subsequently, the virus was proven a novel coronavirus and named SARS-CoV-2. The outbreak of novel coronavirus has been determined as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by WHO on January 31, 2020. Similar to other coronaviruses like the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoV and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) CoV, the novel coronavirus was reported to spread via respiratory droplets and close contact from human to human, which means the virus is highly infectious and dangerous. Unfortunately, till now the virus has spread to over 200 countries/territories/areas around the world and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is continuing to grow. Currently, information sharing and transparency are essential for risk assessment and epidemic control in all endemic areas. In this article, we compared SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV and influenza virus, discussed current researching progress of COVID-19, including clinical characteristics, pathological changes, treatment measures, and so on.",
      "Transmission routes of Covid-19 virus in the Diamond Princess Cruise ship Background: An outbreak of COVID-19 occurred on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in January and February 2020. We analysed information about cases to infer transmission dynamics and potential modes of transmission. Methods: We collected the daily number of 197 symptomatic cases, and that of the 146 passenger cases in two categories, i.e. those who stayed and did not stay in the same stateroom. We retrieved the quarantine details and the ship's 14-day itinerary. We searched the websites of national/local health authority along the cruise routes and local news using Google for locally confirmed cases associated with the ship. We obtained the design of air conditioning and sewage treatment of the ship from literature. We back-calculated the dates of infection from the epidemic curve and compared with the start of on-board quarantine. Results: Major infections started on Jan 28 and completed by Feb 6 for passengers except those who stayed in the same stateroom with infected individual(s). No other confirmed cases were identified among the disembarked people in Hong Kong except an 80 years old passenger. No confirmed cases were reported in three other stopovers between Jan 27-31 associated with disembarked passengers or visitors from the ship, however two Okinawa taxi drivers became confirmed cases in association with driving the ship passengers. Infection among passengers after Feb 6 was limited to those who stayed in the same stateroom with an infected passenger. Infections in crew members peaked on Feb 7, suggesting significant transmission among crew members after quarantine on Feb 5. Conclusions: We infer that the ship central air conditioning system did not play a role, i.e. the long-range airborne route was absent in the outbreak. Most transmission appears to have occurred through close contact and fomites.",
      "Recombinant baculovirus expressing the FrC-OVA protein induces protective antitumor immunity in an EG7-OVA mouse model BACKGROUND: The baculovirus (BV) Autographa californica multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus has been used in numerous protein expression systems because of its ability to infect insect cells and serves as a useful vaccination vector with several benefits, such as its low clinical risks and posttranslational modification ability. We recently reported that dendritic cells (DCs) infected with BV stimulated antitumor immunity. The recombinant BV (rBV) also strongly stimulated peptide-specific T-cells and antitumor immunity. In this study, the stimulation of an immune response against EG7-OVA tumors in mice by a recombinant baculovirus-based combination vaccine expressing fragment C-ovalbumin (FrC-OVA-BV; rBV) was evaluated. RESULTS: We constructed an rBV expressing fragment C (FrC) of tetanus toxin containing a promiscuous MHC II-binding sequence and a p30-ovalbumin (OVA) peptide that functions in the MHC I pathway. The results showed that rBV activated the CD8(+) T-cell-mediated response much more efficiently than the wild-type BV (wtBV). Experiments with EG7-OVA tumor mouse models showed that rBV significantly decreased tumor volume and increased survival compared with those in the wild-type BV or FrC-OVA DNA vaccine groups. In addition, a significant antitumor effect of classic prophylactic or therapeutic vaccinations was observed for rBV against EG7-OVA-induced tumors compared with that in the controls. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that FrC-OVA-BV (rBV) induced antitumor immunity, paving the way for its use in BV immunotherapy against malignancies.",

      "Antibody Dependent Enhancement Due to Original Antigenic Sin and the Development of SARS Human coronavirus (HCoV) is one of the most common causes of respiratory tract infections throughout the world. Two phenomena observed so far in the development of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic deserve further attention. First, the relative absence of clinical signs of infections in children, second, the early appearance of IgG in certain patients. From the point of view of immune system physiology, such an early rise of specific IgG is expected in secondary immune responses when memory to a cross-reactive antigen is present, usually from an earlier infection with a coronavirus. It is actually typical for the immune system to respond, to what it already knows, a phenomenon that has been observed in many infections with closely related viruses and has been termed \u201coriginal antigenic sin.\u201d The question then arises whether such cross-reactive antibodies are protective or not against the new virus. The worst scenario would be when such cross-reactive memory antibodies to related coronaviruses would not only be non-protective but even enhance infection and the clinical course. Such a phenomenon of antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) has already been described in several viral infections. Thus, the development of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in the course of COVID-19 might not be a simple sign of viral clearance and developing protection against the virus. On the contrary, due to cross-reaction to related coronavirus strains from earlier infections, in certain patients IgG might enhance clinical progression due to ADE. The patient's viral history of coronavirus infection might be crucial to the development of the current infection with SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, it poses a note of caution when treating COVID-19 patients with convalescent sera.",

      "Clinical course and outcome of 107 patients infected with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, discharged from two hospitals in Wuhan, China BACKGROUND: In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was reported from Wuhan, China. Information on the clinical course and prognosis of COVID-19 was not thoroughly described. We described the clinical courses and prognosis in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Retrospective case series of COVID-19 patients from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan and Xishui Hospital, Hubei Province, China, up to February 10, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, and clinical data were collected. The clinical course of survivors and non-survivors were compared. Risk factors for death were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 107 discharged patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. The clinical course of COVID-19 presented as a tri-phasic pattern. Week 1 after illness onset was characterized by fever, cough, dyspnea, lymphopenia, and radiological multi-lobar pulmonary infiltrates. In severe cases, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, acute myocardial injury, and adult respiratory distress syndrome were observed. During week 2, in mild cases, fever, cough, and systemic symptoms began to resolve and platelet count rose to normal range, but lymphopenia persisted. In severe cases, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and deteriorating multi-organ dysfunction were dominant. By week 3, mild cases had clinically resolved except for lymphopenia. However, severe cases showed persistent lymphopenia, severe acute respiratory dyspnea syndrome, refractory shock, anuric acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and death. Older age and male sex were independent risk factors for poor outcome of the illness. CONCLUSIONS: A period of 7\u201313 days after illness onset is the critical stage in the COVID-19 course. Age and male gender were independent risk factors for death of COVID-19.",

      "A Machine Learning Model Reveals Older Age and Delayed Hospitalization as Predictors of Mortality in Patients with COVID-19 Objective: The recent pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is increasingly causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and significant mortality. We aim here to identify the risk factors associated with mortality of coronavirus infected persons using a supervised machine learning approach. Research Design and Methods: Clinical data of 1085 cases of COVID-19 from 13th January to 28th February, 2020 was obtained from Kaggle, an online community of Data scientists. 430 cases were selected for the final analysis. Random Forest classification algorithm was implemented on the dataset to identify the important predictors and their effects on mortality. Results: The Area under the ROC curve obtained during model validation on the test dataset was 0.97. Age was the most important variable in predicting mortality followed by the time gap between symptom onset and hospitalization. Conclusions: Patients aged beyond 62 years are at higher risk of fatality whereas hospitalization within 2 days of the onset of symptoms could reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients.",
      "Virus-Like Particles-Based Mucosal Nanovaccines Virus-like particles (VLPs) are protein complexes that resemble a virus and constitute highly immunogenic entities as they mimic the pathogen at an important degree. Among nanovaccines, those based on VLPs are the most successful thus far with some formulations already commercialized (e.g., those against hepatitis B and E viruses and human papillomavirus). This chapter highlights the advantages of VLPs-based vaccines, describing approaches for their design and transmittance of the state of the art for mucosal VLPs-based vaccines development. Several candidates have been produced in insect cells, plants, and E. coli and mammalian cells; they have been mainly evaluated in i.n. and oral immunization schemes. i.n. vaccines against the influenza virus and the Norwalk virus are the most advanced applications. For the latter, i.n. formulations are under clinical evaluation. Perspectives for the field comprise the expansion of the use of low-cost platforms such as plants and bacteria, the development of multiepitopic/multivalent vaccines, and computationally designed VLPs. Mucosal VLPs-based vaccines stand as a major promising approach in vaccinology and the initiation of more clinical trials is envisaged in a short time.",
      "Interleukin-18 expression and the response to treatment in patients with psoriasis INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to demonstrate interleukin-18 (IL-18) expression in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions in comparison to keratinocytes from uninvolved skin and to study the change of expression after therapeutic interventions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study included 16 patients of different clinical subtypes of psoriasis. Interleukin-18 gene expression analysis was performed using real time quantitative PCR. Three biopsies were obtained from each patient. Two were taken from the lesional psoriatic skin and from uninvolved skin before starting treatment. A third lesional skin biopsy was taken at the end of 2 months of treatment. The treatment was in the form of topical steroids or oral systemic methotrexate. RESULTS: Of all 16 studied patients, significantly increased IL-18 expression was noted in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions before and after treatment when compared to keratinocytes from uninvolved skin (p = 0.001 and p = 0.002 respectively). The IL-18 expression in the skin lesions after treatment was significantly lower than lesional skin before treatment (p = 0.023). In psoriatic skin lesions of all studied patients IL-18 expression was significantly correlated with disease duration (r = 0.40 and p = 0.01) and clinical severity of psoriasis (r = 0.72 and p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Increased IL-18 expression in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions of our patients and its correlation with disease duration and severity supported the concept of psoriasis as a T cell mediated autoimmune disease. This could establish therapeutic and preventive approaches for psoriasis that ultimately lead to improved outcomes for patients.",
      "Phenotypic characteristics and prognosis of inpatients with COVID-19 and diabetes: the CORONADO study AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a life-threatening infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Diabetes has rapidly emerged as a major comorbidity for COVID-19 severity. However, the phenotypic characteristics of diabetes in COVID-19 patients are unknown. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide multicentre observational study in people with diabetes hospitalised for COVID-19 in 53 French centres in the period 10-31 March 2020. The primary outcome combined tracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation and/or death within 7 days of admission. Age- and sex-adjusted multivariable logistic regressions were performed to assess the prognostic value of clinical and biological features with the endpoint. ORs are reported for a 1 SD increase after standardisation. RESULTS: The current analysis focused on 1317 participants: 64.9% men, mean age 69.8 \u00b1 13.0 years, median BMI 28.4 (25th-75th percentile: 25.0-32.7) kg/m2; with a predominance of type 2 diabetes (88.5%). Microvascular and macrovascular diabetic complications were found in 46.8% and 40.8% of cases, respectively. The primary outcome was encountered in 29.0% (95% CI 26.6, 31.5) of participants, while 10.6% (9.0, 12.4) died and 18.0% (16.0, 20.2) were discharged on day 7. In univariate analysis, characteristics prior to admission significantly associated with the primary outcome were sex, BMI and previous treatment with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers, but not age, type of diabetes, HbA1c, diabetic complications or glucose-lowering therapies. In multivariable analyses with covariates prior to admission, only BMI remained positively associated with the primary outcome (OR 1.28 [1.10, 1.47]). On admission, dyspnoea (OR 2.10 [1.31, 3.35]), as well as lymphocyte count (OR 0.67 [0.50, 0.88]), C-reactive protein (OR 1.93 [1.43, 2.59]) and AST (OR 2.23 [1.70, 2.93]) levels were independent predictors of the primary outcome. Finally, age (OR 2.48 [1.74, 3.53]), treated obstructive sleep apnoea (OR 2.80 [1.46, 5.38]), and microvascular (OR 2.14 [1.16, 3.94]) and macrovascular complications (OR 2.54 [1.44, 4.50]) were independently associated with the risk of death on day 7. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATIONS: In people with diabetes hospitalised for COVID-19, BMI, but not long-term glucose control, was positively and independently associated with tracheal intubation and/or death within 7 days.

      "Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 671 COVID-19 patients in Henan Province, China BACKGROUND: Despite many reports on the characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, relatively little is known about the transmission features of COVID-19 outside Wuhan, especially at the provincial level. METHODS: We collected epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and occupation information, along with contact history, of 671 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 reported from January 23 to February 5, 2020, in Henan province, China. We described characteristics of these cases, compared the diagnostic accuracy and features of blood testing, computed tomography (CT) scans and X-rays, and analysed SARS-CoV-2 transmission sources and patients' occupations in Henan province. RESULTS: The mean age of patients in this case series was 43 years, 56.2% were male and 22.4% had coexisting medical disorders. The death rate was 0.3%. Fourteen patients did not show any symptoms. Lymphocyte percentage was associated with disease severity (&#967;2 = 6.71, P = 0.035) but had a large variation in each sample group. The mean time from illness onset to diagnosis was 5.6 days. A total of 330 patients had ever lived in or visited Wuhan, 150 had contact with confirmed cases, 323 had been to a hospital and 119 had been to a wet market. There were 33 patients who did not have a traceable transmission source, with 21.2% of these being farmers and 15.2% being workmen. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphocyte percentage was a sign of severe COVID-19 in general but was not a good diagnostic index. Longer time from illness onset to diagnosis was associated with higher COVID-19 severity, older age, higher likelihood of having coexisting cardiovascular diseases including hypertension, and being male. Farming was found to be a high-risk occupation in Henan province, China.",

      "Age-adjusted associations between comorbidity and outcomes of COVID-19: a review of the evidence Background: Current evidence suggests that older people and people with underlying comorbidities are at increased risk of severe disease and death following hospitalisation with COVID-19. As comorbidity increases with age, it is necessary to understand the age-adjusted relationship between comorbidity and COVID-19 outcomes, in order to enhance planning capabilities and our understanding of COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a rapid, comprehensive review of the literature up to 10 April 2020, to assess the international empirical evidence on the association between comorbidities and severe or critical care outcomes of COVID-19, after accounting for age, among hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Results: After screening 579 studies, we identified seven studies eligible for inclusion and these were synthesised narratively. All were from China. The emerging evidence base mostly indicates that after adjustment for age (and in some cases other potential confounders), obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive airways disease (COPD), and cancer are all associated with worse outcomes. The largest study, using a large nationwide sample of COVID-19 patients in China, found that those with multiple comorbidities had more than twice the risk of a severe outcome or death compared with patients with no comorbidities, after adjusting for age and smoking (HR=2.59, 95% CI 1.61, 4.17). Conclusions: This review summarises for clinicians, policymakers, and academics the most robust evidence to date on this topic, to inform the management of patients and control measures for tackling the pandemic. Given the intersection of comorbidity with ethnicity and social disadvantage, these findings also have important implications for health inequalities. As the pandemic develops, further research should confirm these trends in other settings outside China and explore mechanisms by which various underlying health conditions increase risk of severe COVID-19.",

      "Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA identified in Eastern India: Possible implications for the ongoing outbreak in India and impact on viral structure and host susceptibility. Direct massively parallel sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genome was undertaken from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples of infected individuals in Eastern India. Seven of the isolates belonged to the A2a clade, while one belonged to the B4 clade. Specific mutations, characteristic of the A2a clade, were also detected, which included the P323L in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and D614G in the Spike glycoprotein. Further, our data revealed emergence of novel subclones harbouring nonsynonymous mutations, viz. G1124V in Spike (S) protein, R203K, and G204R in the nucleocapsid (N) protein. The N protein mutations reside in the SR-rich region involved in viral capsid formation and the S protein mutation is in the S2 domain, which is involved in triggering viral fusion with the host cell membrane. Interesting correlation was observed between these mutations and travel or contact history of COVID-19 positive cases. Consequent alterations of miRNA binding and structure were also predicted for these mutations. More importantly, the possible implications of mutation D614G (in SD domain) and G1124V (in S2 subunit) on the structural stability of S protein have also been discussed.

      "The substrate specificity of SARS coronavirus 3C-like proteinase Abstract The 3C-like proteinase of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) has been proposed to be a key target for structural based drug design against SARS. We have designed and synthesized 34 peptide substrates and determined their hydrolysis activities. The conserved core sequence of the native cleavage site is optimized for high hydrolysis activity. Residues at position P4, P3, and P3\u2032 are critical for substrate recognition and binding, and increment of \u03b2-sheet conformation tendency is also helpful. A comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) model was constructed. Based on the mutation data and CoMFA model, a multiply mutated octapeptide S24 was designed for higher activity. The experimentally determined hydrolysis activity of S24 is the highest in all designed substrates and is close to that predicted by CoMFA. These results offer helpful information for the research on the mechanism of substrate recognition of coronavirus 3C-like proteinase.",

      "Physical Rehabilitation Needs in the BRICS Nations from 1990 to 2017: Cross-National Analyses Using Data from the Global Burden of Disease Study Background: This study analyzes the current and evolving physical rehabilitation needs of BRICS nations (Brazil, Russian Federation, India, China, South Africa), a coalition of large emergent economies increasingly important for global health. Methods: Secondary, cross-national analyses of data on Years Lived with Disability (YLDs) were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017. Total physical rehabilitation needs, and those stratified per major condition groups are analyzed for the year 2017 (current needs), and for every year since 1990 (evolution over time). ANOVAs are used to detect significant yearly changes. Results: Total physical rehabilitation needs have increased significantly from 1990 to 2017 in each of the BRICS nations, in every metric analyzed (YLD Counts, YLDs per 100,000 people, and percentage of YLDs relevant to physical rehabilitation; all p < 0.01). Musculoskeletal & pain conditions were leading cause of physical rehabilitation needs across the BRICS nations but to varying degrees: from 36% in South Africa to 60% in Brazil. Country-specific trends include: 25% of South African needs were from HIV-related conditions (no other BRICS nation had more than 1%); India had both absolute and relative growths of pediatric rehabilitation needs (p < 0.01); China had an exponential growth in the per-capita needs from neurological and neoplastic conditions (p < 0.01; r(2) = 0.97); Brazil had a both absolute and relative growth of needs coming from musculoskeletal & pain conditions (p < 0.01); and the Russian Federation had the highest neurological rehabilitation needs per capita in 2017 (over than three times those of India, South Africa or Brazil). Conclusions: total physical rehabilitation needs have been increasing in each of the BRICS nations, both in absolute and relative values. Apart from the common growing trend, each of the BRICS nations had own patterns for the amount, typology, and evolution of their physical rehabilitation needs, which must be taken into account while planning for health and physical rehabilitation programs, policies and resources.",
      "Predictors of severe or lethal COVID-19, including Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers, in a sample of infected Italian citizens AIMS: This retrospective case-control study was aimed at identifying potential independent predictors of severe/lethal COVID-19, including the treatment with Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and/or Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs). METHODS AND RESULTS: All adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection in two Italian provinces were followed for a median of 24 days. ARBs and/or ACEi treatments, and hypertension, diabetes, cancer, COPD, renal and major cardiovascular diseases (CVD) were extracted from clinical charts and electronic health records, up to two years before infection. The sample consisted of 1603 subjects (mean age 58.0y; 47.3% males): 454 (28.3%) had severe symptoms, 192 (12.0%) very severe or lethal disease (154 deaths; mean age 79.3 years; 70.8% hypertensive, 42.2% with CVD). The youngest deceased person aged 44 years. Among hypertensive subjects (n = 543), the proportion of those treated with ARBs or ACEi were 88.4%, 78.7% and 80.6% among patients with mild, severe and very severe/lethal disease, respectively. At multivariate analysis, no association was observed between therapy and disease severity (Adjusted OR for very severe/lethal COVID-19: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.50-1.49). Significant predictors of severe disease were older age (with AORs largely increasing after 70 years of age), male gender (AOR: 1.76; 1.40-2.23), diabetes (AOR: 1.52; 1.05-2.18), CVD (AOR: 1.88; 1.32-2.70) and COPD (AOR: 1.88; 1.11-3.20). Only gender, age and diabetes also predicted very severe/lethal disease. CONCLUSION: No association was found between COVID-19 severity and treatment with ARBs and/or ACEi, supporting the recommendation to continue medication for all patients unless otherwise advised by their physicians.",
      "Dissemination and co-circulation of SARS-CoV2 subclades exhibiting enhanced transmission associated with increased mortality in Western Europe and the United States Mechanisms underlying the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like clinical manifestations leading to deaths in patients who develop COVID-19 remain uncharacterized. While multiple factors could influence these clinical outcomes, we explored if differences in transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV2 variants could contribute to these terminal clinical consequences of COVID-19. We analyzed 34,412 SARS-CoV2 sequences deposited in the Global Initiative for Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) SARS-CoV2 sequence database to determine if regional differences in circulating strain variants correlated with increased mortality in Europe, the United States, and California. We found two subclades descending from the Wuhan HU-1 strain that rapidly became dominant in Western Europe and the United States. These variants contained nonsynonymous nucleotide mutations in the Orf1ab segment encoding RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (C14408T), the spike protein gene (A23403G), and Orf1a (G25563T), which resulted in non-conservative amino acid substitutions P323L, D614G, and Q57H, respectively. In Western Europe, the A23403G-C14408T subclade dominated, while in the US, the A23403G-C14408T-G25563T mutant became the dominant strain in New York and parts of California. The high cumulative frequencies of both subclades showed inconsistent but significant association with high cumulative CFRs in some of the regions. When the frequencies of the subclades were analyzed by their 7-day moving averages across each epidemic, we found co-circulation of both subclades to temporally correlate with peak mortality periods. We postulate that in areas with high numbers of these co-circulating subclades, a person may get serially infected. The second infection may trigger a hyperinflammatory response similar to the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) response, which could explain the ARDS-like manifestations observed in people with co-morbidity, who may not mount sufficient levels of neutralizing antibodies against the first infection. Further studies are necessary but the implication of such a mechanism will need to be considered for all current COVID-19 vaccine designs.",

      "SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) structural and evolutionary dynamicome: Insights into functional evolution and human genomics The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has challenged the speed at which laboratories discover the viral composition and study health outcomes. The small ~30-kb ssRNA genome of coronaviruses makes them adept at cross-species spread, but also enable a robust understanding of all the proteins the viral genome encodes. We have employed protein modeling, molecular dynamic simulations, evolutionary mapping, and 3D printing to gain a full proteome- and dynamicome-level understanding of SARS-CoV-2. We established the Viral Integrated Structural Evolution Dynamic Database (VIStEDD at prokoplab.com/vistedd) to facilitate future discoveries and educational use. Here, we highlight the use of VIStEDD for nsp6, nucleocapsid (N), and spike (S) surface glycoprotein. For both nsp6 and N, we found highly conserved surface amino acids that likely drive protein-protein interactions. In characterizing viral S protein, we developed a quantitative dynamics cross-correlation matrix to gain insights into its interactions with the angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-solute carrier family 6 member 19 (SLC6A19) dimer. Using this quantitative matrix, we elucidated 47 potential functional missense variants from genomic databases within ACE2/SLC6A19/transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), warranting genomic enrichment analyses in SARS-CoV-2 patients. These variants had ultralow frequency but existed in males hemizygous for ACE2. Two ACE2 noncoding variants (rs4646118 and rs143185769) present in ~9% of individuals of African descent may regulate ACE2 expression and may be associated with increased susceptibility of African Americans to SARS-CoV-2. We propose that this SARS-CoV-2 database may aid research into the ongoing pandemic.",
      "Combined experimental and theoretical study of long-range interactions modulating dimerization and activity of yeast geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase. We present here how two amino acid residues in the first helix distal from the main dimer interface modulate the dimerization and activity of a geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPs). The enzyme catalyzes condensation of farnesyl diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate to generate a C(20) product as a precursor for chlorophylls, carotenoids, and geranylgeranylated proteins. The 3D structure of GGPPs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals an unique positioning of the N-terminal helix A, which protrudes into the other subunit and stabilizes dimerization, although it is far from the main dimer interface. Through a series of mutants that were characterized by analytic ultracentrifugation (AUC), the replacement of L8 and I9 at this helix with Gly was found sufficient to disrupt the dimer into a monomer, leading to at least 10(3)-fold reduction in activity. Molecular dynamics simulations and free energy decomposition analyses revealed the possible effects of the mutations on the protein structures and several critical interactions for maintaining dimerization. Further site-directed mutagenesis and AUC studies elucidated the molecular mechanism for modulating dimerization and activity by long-range interactions.",
      "Cytosolic DNA sensing through cGAS and STING is inactivated by gene mutations in pangolins The release of DNA into the cytoplasm upon damage to the nucleus or during viral infection triggers an interferon-mediated defense response, inflammation and cell death. In human cells cytoplasmic DNA is sensed by cyclic GMP-AMP Synthase (cGAS) and Absent In Melanoma 2 (AIM2). Here, we report the identification of a \u201cnatural knockout\u201d model of cGAS. Comparative genomics of phylogenetically diverse mammalian species showed that cGAS and its interaction partner Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) have been inactivated by mutations in the Malayan pangolin whereas other mammals retained intact copies of these genes. The coding sequences of CGAS and STING1 are also disrupted by premature stop codons and frame-shift mutations in Chinese and tree pangolins, suggesting that expression of these genes was lost in a common ancestor of all pangolins that lived more than 20 million years ago. AIM2 is retained in a functional form in pangolins whereas it is inactivated by mutations in carnivorans, the phylogenetic sister group of pangolins. The deficiency of cGAS and STING points to the existence of alternative mechanisms of controlling cytoplasmic DNA-associated cell damage and viral infections in pangolins.

      "COVID-19 is a Real Headache! After the emergence of a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was initially characterized by fever, sore throat, cough, and dyspnea, mainly manifestations of respiratory system. However, other manifestations such as headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, loss of taste and smell were added to the clinical spectrum, during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. The reports on the neurological findings are increasing rapidly and headache seems to be the leader on the symptom list. Headache was reported in 11%-34% of the hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but clinical features of these headaches were totally missing in available publications. According to our initial experience, significant features of headache presentation in the symptomatic COVID-19 patients were new-onset, moderate-severe, bilateral headache with pulsating or pressing quality in the temporoparietal, forehead or periorbital region. The most striking features of the headache were sudden to gradual onset and poor response to common analgesics, or high relapse rate, that was limited to the active phase of the COVID-19. Symptomatic COVID-19 patients, around 6%-10%, also reported headache as a presenting symptom. The possible pathophysiological mechanisms of headache include activation of peripheral trigeminal nerve endings by the SARS-CoV-2 directly or through the vasculopathy and/or increased circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and hypoxia. We concluded that as a common non-respiratory symptom of COVID-19, headache should not be overlooked, and its characteristics should be recorded with scrutiny.",
      "\u201cARDS and Cytokine Storm in SARS-CoV-2 Infected Caribbean Vervets\u201d SARS-CoV-2 induces a wide range of disease severity ranging from asymptomatic infection, to a life-threating illness, particularly in the elderly and persons with comorbid conditions. Up to now, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than five million and led to more than 300,000 deaths worldwide. Among those persons with serious COVID-19 disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and often fatal presentation. SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS is difficult to treat clinically, and new therapeutic strategies are needed. In order to evaluate such therapeutic strategies, animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection that manifest severe disease are needed. Here we report fatal ARDS in two African green monkeys (AGMs) infected with SARS-CoV-2 that demonstrated pathological lesions and disease similar to severe COVID-19 in humans. Moreover, we report the observation of cytokine release (cytokine storm) in three of four infected AGMs. All four animals showed increased levels of IL-6 in plasma, a predictive marker and presumptive therapeutic target in humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results suggest the AGM is a useful model to study disease pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, and for the evaluation of therapeutic interventions designed to combat serious pulmonary disease associated with this infection.",
      "Recommendations for coronavirus infection in rheumatic diseases treated with biologic therapy The Coronavirus-associated disease, that was first identified in 2019 in China (CoViD-19), is a pandemic caused by a bat-derived beta-coronavirus, named SARS-CoV2. It shares homology with SARS and MERS-CoV, responsible for past outbreaks in China and in Middle East. SARS-CoV2 spread from China where the first infections were described in December 2019 and is responsible for the respiratory symptoms that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. A cytokine storm has been shown in patients who develop fatal complications, as observed in past coronavirus infections. The management includes ventilatory support and broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, empirically utilized, as a targeted therapy and vaccines have not been developed. Based upon our limited knowledge on the pathogenesis of CoViD-19, a potential role of some anti-rheumatic drugs may be hypothesized, acting as direct antivirals or targeting host immune response. Antimalarial drugs, commonly used in rheumatology, may alter the lysosomal proteases that mediates the viral entry into the cell and have demonstrated efficacy in improving the infection. Anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6 may interfere with the cytokine storm in severe cases and use of tocilizumab has shown good outcomes in a small cohort. Baricitinib has both antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Checkpoints inhibitors such as anti-CD200 and anti-PD1 could have a role in the treatment of CoViD-19. Rheumatic disease patients taking immunosuppressive drugs should be recommended to maintain the chronic therapy, prevent infection by avoiding social contacts and pausing immunosuppressants in case of infection. National and international registries are being created to collect data on rheumatic patients with CoViD-19.",
      "Cilia-associated bacteria in fatal Bordetella bronchiseptica pneumonia of dogs and cats. Bordetella bronchiseptica frequently causes nonfatal tracheobronchitis, but its role in fatal pneumonia is less recognized. Our study evaluated histologic identification of cilia-associated bacteria as a method for diagnosis of B. bronchiseptica pneumonia. Cases of fatal bronchopneumonia were studied retrospectively, excluding neonates and cases of aspiration pneumonia, minor lung lesions, or autolysis. The study population comprised 36 canine and 31 feline cases of bronchopneumonia. B. bronchiseptica was identified in 8 of 36 canine and 14 of 31 feline cases based on immunohistochemistry (IHC) using serum from a rabbit hyperimmunized with pertactin, PCR testing (Fla2/Fla12), and/or bacterial culture data when available. Of these, IHC was positive in 4 canine and 7 feline cases, PCR was positive in 8 canine and 14 feline cases, and B. bronchiseptica was isolated in 2 of 5 canine and 3 of 9 feline cases tested. Examination of histologic sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin revealed bronchial cilia-associated bacteria in 4 of 36 canine and 5 of 31 feline cases; these were all positive by IHC and PCR. The presence of cilia-associated bacteria had been noted in the pathology report for only 2 of these 9 cases. Thus, the presence of cilia-associated bacteria seems frequently overlooked by pathologists, but is a diagnostically significant feature of B. bronchiseptica pneumonia. A specific diagnosis of B. bronchiseptica pneumonia is important because it suggests primary or opportunistic bacterial pneumonia rather than aspiration pneumonia, and because of the risk of animal-to-animal transmission of B. bronchiseptica, the availability of vaccines for disease prevention, and the potential zoonotic risk to immunocompromised pet owners.",

      "A prospective study comparing standard laryngoscopy to the trachview videoscope system for orotracheal intubation by emergency medicine residents and medical students Study objectives: Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy is a skill that can be difficult for emergency physicians to use in the setting of an emergency intubation. The TrachView Videoscope (TV) consists of a narrow high-resolution fiberoptic cable whose tip is positioned at the distal end of the endotracheal tube. The image is displayed on a small portable bedside monitor. In this way, the TV does not alter the standard method of intubation but adds a second, possibly improved, view of the vocal cords. The TV has never been formally studied. We determine the ease of use and improvement in the percentage of glottic opening (POGO) score using the TV by individuals with various levels of intubation experience. Methods: The study was conducted in 2 phases on a mannequin model during an airway laboratory for emergency medicine residents and medical students in a university setting. Phase 1 consisted of a nonrandomized group sequential study design in which, after a 10-minute demonstration of the TV, emergency medicine residents assessed the POGO score using direct laryngoscopy (DL) and compared it with their observed POGO score using the TV. Part 2 consisted of a crossover study with first- and second-year medical students with no intubation experience. The students were randomized into 2 groups that differed by the method of intubation instruction given first: DL or TV. The students were given a 10-minute demonstration of each technique and had 2 attempts to return the demonstration. The POGO score noted by the student was recorded for each technique. The groups were then crossed and the process was repeated. Additional information collected from study subjects included ease of use of the TV and improvement in intubation using the TV. Results: In phase 1, the residents consisted of 4 postgraduate year (PGY)-1, 10 PGY-2, and 11 PGY-3 residents, and 3 participants whose level was not recorded, for a total of 28. Overall, the median POGO score for DL was 50%, and the median POGO score for TV was 100% (P<.001). The median difference in POGO scores (TV and DL) was as follows: 50% for PGY-1 residents, 50% for PGY-2 residents, and 25% for PGY-3 residents. As for ease of use, 85.7% (24) reported that the TV was \u201ceasy\u201d to use, 10.7% (3) were undecided, and 3.6% (1) reported that the TV was \u201cdifficult\u201d to use, whereas 82.1% (23) reported that the TV improved their intubation attempt, 14.3% (4) reported no difference, and 3.6% (1) reported that the TV made the intubation attempt more difficult. In phase 2, there were 37 participants. Overall, the median TV and DL POGO scores were 75% and 25%, respectively (P=.004). The median difference in POGO scores (TV and DL) for the 2 groups was as follows: 75% for group 1 and 50% for group 2. Of all the participants, 67.6% (25) ranked the TV as \u201ceasy\u201d to use, 21.6% (8) were undecided, and 10.8% (4) ranked the TV as \u201cdifficult\u201d to use, whereas 56.8% percent (21) reported that the TV improved their intubation attempts, 27% (10) reported no difference, and 10.8% (4) reported that the TV made the intubation attempts more difficult. Conclusion: The Trachview Videoscope is easy to use and improves the POGO score and subjective evaluation of performance for intubation by individuals with various experience levels.",
      "An easily adopted murine model of distal pancreatectomy for investigating immunotherapy efficacy in resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma Background Although surgery provides the greatest therapeutic benefit to eligible pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients it does not significantly improve survival for the majority of patients. Unfortunately our understanding of the therapeutic benefit of combining surgery with different treatment modalities including promising immunotherapeutics is limited by the current lack of easily adopted surgical models. The purpose of this study was to develop a surgically resectable model of PDAC in immunocompetent mice for use in preclinical investigations. Materials and Methods Surgically resectable orthotopic tumors were generated by injecting Pan02 cells into the tail of the pancreas. Fifteen days post implantation the primary tumors and tail of the pancreas were resected by laparotomy while preserving the spleen. Splenic function, tumor growth, immune phenotyping and survival were assessed following surgical resection of the primary tumor mass. Results As expected orthotopic tumor implants recapitulated many of the major histological hallmarks of PDAC including disrupted lobular structure and vascular invasion. Preservation of splenic immune cell viability and function was not associated with improved survival following surgery alone. However, pre-operative vaccination with GVAX was associated with improved survival which was not impacted by surgery. Conclusion This represents the first murine model of surgically resectable murine model of PDAC which recapitulates known pathological hallmarks of human disease in an immune competent model while allowing spleen preservation. This relatively simple and easily adopted approach provides an ideal platform to examine the efficacy of potential immunotherapy combinations for PDAC surgery patients.",
      "Development of a nasal spray containing xylometazoline hydrochloride and iota-carrageenan for the symptomatic relief of nasal congestion caused by rhinitis and sinusitis INTRODUCTION: Xylometazoline hydrochloride (HCl) is a nasal decongestant that causes vasoconstriction in the nasal submucosa. It has been used for more than 50 years for the treatment of nasal congestion caused by rhinitis/sinusitis. Iota-carrageenan is effective against a broad variety of respiratory viruses, which are the most common cause of infections of the upper respiratory tract. Therefore, it is used as the active component in the antiviral nasal spray Coldamaris prophylactic (1.2 mg/mL iota-carrageenan in 0.5% NaCl) and other medical device nasal sprays that are approved and marketed in the EU. Recently, we developed a nasal spray formulation containing both xylometazoline HCl (0.05%) and iota-carrageenan (0.12%) that provides decongestion and antiviral protection of the nasal mucosa at the same time. RESULTS: A set of in vitro experiments revealed that the vasoconstrictive properties of xylometazoline HCl and the antiviral effectiveness of iota-carrageenan against human rhinovirus (hRV) 1a, hRV8 and human coronavirus OC43 were maintained in the formulation containing these two compounds. Permeation experiments using bovine nasal mucosa showed that iota-carrageenan had no significant influence on the permeation of xylometazoline HCl. Finally, in the local tolerance and toxicity study, it was shown that the formulation was well tolerated at the application site with no occurrence of erythema or edema in the nostrils of all rabbits or any signs of toxicity in any of the organs and tissues inspected. CONCLUSION: Investigations on compatibility of xylometazoline HCl and iota-carrageenan demonstrated that the substances do not influence each other, allowing both to fulfill their known specific clinical efficacy (xylometazoline HCl) and effectiveness (iota-carrageenan).",

      "Triage tool for the rationing of blood for massively bleeding patients during a severe national blood shortage: guidance from the National Blood Transfusion Committee The emerging COVID\u201019 pandemic has overwhelmed healthcare resources worldwide, and for transfusion services this could potentially result in rapid imbalance between supply and demand due to a severe shortage of blood donors. This may result in insufficient blood components to meet every patient's needs resulting in difficult decisions about which patients with major bleeding do and do not receive active transfusion support. This document, which was prepared on behalf of the National Blood Transfusion Committee in England, provides a framework and triage tool to guide the allocation of blood for patients with massive haemorrhage during severe blood shortage. Its goal is to provide blood transfusions in an ethical, fair, and transparent way to ensure that the greatest number of life years are saved. It is based on an evidence\u2010 and ethics\u2010based Canadian framework, and would become operational where demand for blood greatly exceeds supply, and where all measures to manage supply and demand have been exhausted.

      "Clinical Features and Predictors for Patients with Severe SARS-CoV-2 Pneumonia: a retrospective multicenter cohort study Objectives: This study was performed to investigate clinical features of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and identify risk factors for converting to severe cases in those who had mild to moderate diseases. Methods: In this retrospective, multicenter cohort study, patients with mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were included. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, and clinical outcomes were collected. Data were compared between non-severe and severe patients. Results: 58 patients were included in the final analysis. Compared with non-severe cases, severe patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia had a longer: time to clinical recovery (p=0.0011), duration of viral shedding (p=0.0183), and hospital stay ( p=0.0211). Multivariate logistic regression indicated that lymphocyte count was significantly associated with the rate of converting to severe cases (odds ratio 1.28, 95%CI 1.06-1.54, per 0.1*10 9/L reduced; p=0.007), while using of low-to-moderate doses of systematic corticosteroids was associated with reduced likelihood of converting to a severe case (odds ratio 0.14, 95%CI 0.02-0.80; p=0.0275). Conclusions: The low peripheral blood lymphocyte count was an independent risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients converting to severe cases. This finding may help clinicians more accurately predict prognosis, and triage priorities to improve clinical outcomes.",

Herein, we provide a concise review of current knowledge regarding the involvement of cardiovascular system in the pathogenesis and prognosis of COVID-19. We summarize data from 21 studies involving in total more than 21,000 patients from Asia, Europe and the USA indicating that severe disease is associated with the presence of myocardial injury, heart failure and arrhythmias. Additionally, we present the clinical and laboratory differences between recovered and deceased patients highlighting the importance of cardiac manifestations. For the infected patients, underlying cardiovascular comorbidities and especially existing cardiovascular disease seem to predispose to the development of cardiovascular complications, which are in turn associated with higher mortality rates. We provide mechanistic insights into the underlying mechanisms including direct myocardial damage by the virus and the consequences of the hyperinflammatory syndrome developed later in the disease course. Finally, we summarize current knowledge on therapeutic modalities and recommendations by scientific societies and experts regarding the cardiovascular management of COVID-19 patients.",
      "Emergency trauma care during the outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, in December 2019; the outbreak was caused by a novel coronavirus previously never observed in humans. China has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of the disease. However, a high level of evidence to support the surgical management of potential trauma patients during the novel coronavirus outbreak is still lacking. To regulate the emergency treatment of trauma patients during the outbreak, we drafted this paper from a trauma surgeon perspective according to practical experience in Wuhan. MAIN BODY: The article illustrates the general principles for the triage and evaluation of trauma patients during the outbreak of COVID-19, indications for emergency surgery, and infection prevention and control for medical personnel, providing a practical algorithm for trauma care providers during the outbreak period. CONCLUSIONS: The measures of emergency trauma care that we have provided can protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of effective interventions during the outbreak of COVID-19.",
      "COVID-19: Review of Epidemiology and Potential Treatments Against 2019 Novel Coronavirus An epidemic of extreme respiratory deterrence, pneumonia and shortness of breath, the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, and rapidly spread across China and beyond, with human to human transmission. On February 12, 2020, World Health Organization officially named the new coronavirus disease as coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). Most COVID-19 patients were diagnosed with pneumonia and many were treated using Chinese medicines and other secondary therapies. As of April 22, 2020, the total figure of infected patients has crossed 2.6 million people worldwide with over 180,000 deaths and 700,000 patients that have recovered. Preliminary reports suggest that certain drugs, such as chloroquine and antiviral nucleotide analogues such as remdesivir, which inhibit viral replication, can target the new coronavirus, although their usefulness in the clinic is still under debate. An expert US committee developed the US NIH guidelines for COVID-19 treatment, which was just released and will be regularly updated. This manuscript reviews the epidemiology, etiology, mortality, COVID-19 clinical symptoms, and potential therapeutic drugs, while highlighting the seriousness and damage-induced by SARS-CoV-2."

      "Foodborne viruses Foodborne and waterborne viral infections are increasingly recognized as causes of illness in humans. This increase is partly explained by changes in food processing and consumption patterns that lead to the worldwide availability of high-risk food. As a result, vast outbreaks may occur due to contamination of food by a single foodhandler or at a single source. Although there are numerous fecal\u2013orally transmitted viruses, most reports of foodborne transmission describe infections with Norwalk-like caliciviruses (NLV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV), suggesting that these viruses are associated with the greatest risk of foodborne transmission. NLV and HAV can be transmitted from person to person, or indirectly via food, water, or fomites contaminated with virus-containing feces or vomit. People can be infected without showing symptoms. The high frequency of secondary cases of NLV illness and \u2013 to a lesser extent \u2013 of hepatitis A following a foodborne outbreak results in amplification of the problem. The burden of illness is highest in the elderly, and therefore is likely to increase due to the aging population. For HAV, the burden of illness may increase following hygienic control measures, due to a decreasing population of naturally immune individuals and a concurrent increase in the population at risk. Recent advances in the research of NLV and HAV have led to the development of molecular methods which can be used for molecular tracing of virus strains. These methods can be and have been used for the detection of common source outbreaks. While traditionally certain foods have been implicated in virus outbreaks, it is clear that almost any food item can be involved, provided it has been handled by an infected person. There are no established methods for detection of viruses in foods other than shellfish. Little information is available on disinfection and preventive measures specifically for these viruses. Studies addressing this issue are hampered by the lack of culture systems. As currently available routine monitoring systems exclusively focus on bacterial pathogens, efforts should be made to combine epidemiological and virological information for a combined laboratory-based rapid detection system for foodborne viruses. With better surveillance, including typing information, outbreaks of foodborne infections could be reported faster to prevent further spread.",
      "Clinical features of 30 cases with novel coronavirus pneumonia/ \u4e2d\u534e\u4f20\u67d3\u75c5\u6742\u5fd7 Objective@#To analyze the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection in Shenyang.@*Methods@#The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 30 patients diagnosed with 2019-nCoV infection admitted to Shenyang sixth people&apos;s hospital on January 22, 2020 and February 8, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed.@*Results@#Among the 30 cases, 21 were imported, including 17 from Hubei Province and four from other provinces. Nine cases were local infections. There were 18 men and 12 women, aging from 21 to 72 years with the median of 43 years. Eight cases had underlying diseases including hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease and bronchitis. On admission, two (7%) cases were mild, 19 (63%) cases were ordinary, eight (27%) cases were severe, and one (3%) case was critical. Clinical manifestations mainly include fever, with or without upper respiratory tract symptoms, normal, decreased or slightly increased white blood cell counts, mainly decreased lymphocyte counts, normal or increased c-reactive protein, and normal procalcitonin. The computed tomography (CT) of the early stage of the lungs showed that multiple patchy ground glass shadows were mainly accompanied by consolidation, which often involved both lungs or multiple lobes of one lung. At the moment, the clinical treatment mainly included respiratory support, symptomatic treatment, antiviral treatment adn anti-bacterial treatment. By February 15, a total of nine cases were cured and discharged, including one mild case, six ordinary cases, and two severe cases. In the comparisons between mild/ordinary patients and severe/critical patients, the fever duration in the severe/critical group (median 11.5 d) was significantly longer than that in the light/normal group (median 2 d) (Z=-2.292, P=0.022), and the laboratory tests indicated elevated d-dimer levels (Z=-2.669, P=0.008) and more cases with neutrophilic/lymphocyte ratio &gt; 3 (Z=-4.071, P&lt;0.01).@*Conclusions@#In Shenyang, the early cases with 2019-nCoV infection are mainly imported cases, and expanding local infections gradually develop. Clinical manifestations are mainly characterized by fever and cough. Lung CT performance shows multiple ground glass shadows, mainly accompanied by consolidation. CT changes in the lungs should be closely monitored during the treatment, and CT findings in the lungs may change earlier than the clinical manifestations. Prolonged fever duration, elevated d-dimer level and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio &gt;3 could be used as early warning indicators for severe cases.",
      "Redox process is crucial for inhibitory properties of aurintricarboxylic acid against activity of YopH: virulence factor of Yersinia pestis YopH is a bacterial protein tyrosine phosphatase, which is essential for the viability and pathogenic virulence of the plague-causing Yersinia sp. bacteria. Inactivation of YopH activity would lead to the loss of bacterial pathogenicity. We have studied the inhibitory properties of aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) against YopH phosphatase and found that at nanomolar concentrations ATA reversibly decreases the activity of YopH. Computational docking studies indicated that in all binding poses ATA binds in the YopH active site. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that in the predicted binding pose, ATA binds to the essential Cys403 and Arg409 residues in the active site and has a stronger binding affinity than the natural substrate (pTyr). The cyclic voltammetry experiments suggest that ATA reacts remarkably strongly with molecular oxygen. Additionally, the electrochemical reduction of ATA in the presence of a negative potential from \u22122.0 to 2.5 V generates a current signal, which is observed for hydrogen peroxide. Here we showed that ATA indicates a unique mechanism of YopH inactivation due to a redox process. We proposed that the potent inhibitory properties of ATA are a result of its strong binding in the YopH active site and in situ generation of hydrogen peroxide near catalytic cysteine residue.",
      "Safety and Security Regulations Against Biological Threats Biological threat agents include bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites and their associated toxins. They have the ability to harmfully affect human health ranging from an allergic reactions to serious illnesses, even death. Water, soil, air, plants or animals can be a suitable habitat for their live and proliferation. Because biological agents may reproduce rapidly and initially unnoticed, need minimal resources to survive and can infect at very small doses they can be used as biological warfare agent or bioweapon. Genetic modification may enhance their hazardous and lethal properties, or develop resistance to conventional treatments. In effect, to protect people from dangerous biological agents as well as protect biological agents from intentional malicious acts both, biological safety and biological security measures should be implemented and respected. Because of wide scale of risks caused by biological agents, biosafety and biosecurity issues should be interpreted on many fields taking as priority protection of human beings and their surrounding environment. The reader will familiarize with different point of views on biosafety and biosecurity issues in relation to occupational health and safety, public health and disease surveillance, biodiversity protection, genetic modification of microorganisms, transportation of dangerous goods, storage control of biological agents, dual-use technology, education and awareness raising, weapon of mass destruction threats and bioterrorism acts. The main international agreements, the European Union regulations and principles supporting implementation of national legislation concerning biosafety and biosecurity areas are presented. The role of legally and not-legally binding instruments is highlighted, as well.",
      "Plasma levels of soluble ACE2 are associated with sex, Metabolic Syndrome, and its biomarkers in a large cohort, pointing to a possible mechanism for increased severity in COVID-19 We examined the associations between plasma concentrations of soluble ACE2 and biomarkers of Metabolic Syndrome in a large (N=2,051) sample of individuals who participated in a commercial wellness program and who underwent deep molecular phenotyping. sACE2 levels were significantly higher in men, compared to women, and in individuals with Metabolic Syndrome, compared to controls. sACE2 levels showed reliable associations with all individuals components of Metabolic Syndrome, including obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and as well as markers of liver damage. This profile of associations was statistically significantly stronger in men, compared to women, and suggests that preexisting cardiometabolic conditions might confer increased severity of symptoms in some COVID-19 patients through increased expression of ACE2 in the liver.",
      "Activated macrophages are the main inflammatory cell in COVID-19 interstitial pneumonia infiltrates. Is it possible to show their metabolic activity and thus the grade of inflammatory burden with (18)F-Fluorocholine PET/CT? The recent outbreak of Covid-19 has represented a major challenge for the countries affected by the disease, not only in terms of loss of human life, economic downturn, and constraint on individual freedom, but also for the great pressure on the national health systems and hospitals. The 380 kDa virus has been a perfect storm, especially for those national health systems used to working with limited resources and high intensity rhythms, such as Italy. For the first time in the new century, a virtually unknown fast-spreading disease has caused a public health emergency thus forcing most countries to deal with an insurmountable logistic gap. Hence, every branch of Medicine, even though not directly involved in the treatment, has been called upon to provide its contribution to resolve the crisis. It is now becoming more apparent that Covid-19 is not solely a lung disease, but a complex systemic disease involving several organs and systems. This is due to an abnormal inflammatory response which eventually leads to multisystemic coagulopathy which mainly, but not uniquely, targets the lungs. Although the pathophysiology of this syndrome is still not fully understood, macrophages and their immune complex system seem to play a key role. It is not yet clear why some patients develop the violent immune response which results in pneumonitis while others do not. There are clues indicating that the systemic hyper-inflammation defined as macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), or cytokine storm, requires an increase in choline consumption to synthesize phosphatidylcholine and stimulate phagocytosis, organelle biogenesis, secretory functions, and endocytosis. (18)F-Fluorocholine is a synthetic analog of the naturally occurring choline normally used for PET/CT imaging of prostate cancer patients. (18)F-Fluorocholine could image and quantify the macrophage activity in pulmonary interstitial infiltrates of Covid-19 pneumonia. If the hypothesis is confirmed experimentally, (18)F-Fluorocholine PET/CT could be used to in vivo image and quantify the degree of lung inflammation and potentially stratify the gravity of this disease.",
      "[Diagnostic steps and estimation of disease prognosis in COVID-19-infected patients]. In December 2019, a new coronavirus outbreak hit his head in Wuhan, China. The identified pathogen is a new coronavirus named \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,\" or SARS-CoV-2, and the respiratory syndrome it elicits was named \"coronavirus disease 2019,\" or COVID-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) classified the epidemic as a pandemic in March 2020. We reviewed the currently available international literature on the COVID-19 epidemic. In this paper, we summarize the relevant information for the diagnosis and prognosis of the new coronavirus. Details of the anamnestic factors and initial test results required to raise a clinical suspicion, the method of microbiological sampling, the basic information on the molecular diagnostic test - the 'gold-standard' real-time 'reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) - in particular the diagnostic current public health regulations for testing. We also place emphasis on the parameters of high-risk patients and how to identify them. The COVID-19 pandemic may also have significant epidemiological and health consequences in Hungary. In addition to epidemiological measures to slow down the epidemic, the timely identification and adequate hospital care of already infected individuals is also a key issue in terms of mortality. The chances of critically ill patients can only be improved with high-quality, careful intensive care, and to be able to provide the best, it is useful to use the experience of medical colleagues already working in endemic countries.

      "Clinical Features and Predictors for Patients with Severe SARS-CoV-2 Pneumonia: a retrospective multicenter cohort study Objectives: This study was performed to investigate clinical features of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and identify risk factors for converting to severe cases in those who had mild to moderate diseases. Methods: In this retrospective, multicenter cohort study, patients with mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were included. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, and clinical outcomes were collected. Data were compared between non-severe and severe patients. Results: 58 patients were included in the final analysis. Compared with non-severe cases, severe patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia had a longer: time to clinical recovery (p=0.0011), duration of viral shedding (p=0.0183), and hospital stay ( p=0.0211). Multivariate logistic regression indicated that lymphocyte count was significantly associated with the rate of converting to severe cases (odds ratio 1.28, 95%CI 1.06-1.54, per 0.1*10 9/L reduced; p=0.007), while using of low-to-moderate doses of systematic corticosteroids was associated with reduced likelihood of converting to a severe case (odds ratio 0.14, 95%CI 0.02-0.80; p=0.0275). Conclusions: The low peripheral blood lymphocyte count was an independent risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients converting to severe cases. This finding may help clinicians more accurately predict prognosis, and triage priorities to improve clinical outcomes.",
      "Clinical course and outcome of 107 patients infected with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, discharged from two hospitals in Wuhan, China BACKGROUND: In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was reported from Wuhan, China. Information on the clinical course and prognosis of COVID-19 was not thoroughly described. We described the clinical courses and prognosis in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Retrospective case series of COVID-19 patients from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan and Xishui Hospital, Hubei Province, China, up to February 10, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, and clinical data were collected. The clinical course of survivors and non-survivors were compared. Risk factors for death were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 107 discharged patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. The clinical course of COVID-19 presented as a tri-phasic pattern. Week 1 after illness onset was characterized by fever, cough, dyspnea, lymphopenia, and radiological multi-lobar pulmonary infiltrates. In severe cases, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, acute myocardial injury, and adult respiratory distress syndrome were observed. During week 2, in mild cases, fever, cough, and systemic symptoms began to resolve and platelet count rose to normal range, but lymphopenia persisted. In severe cases, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and deteriorating multi-organ dysfunction were dominant. By week 3, mild cases had clinically resolved except for lymphopenia. However, severe cases showed persistent lymphopenia, severe acute respiratory dyspnea syndrome, refractory shock, anuric acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and death. Older age and male sex were independent risk factors for poor outcome of the illness. CONCLUSIONS: A period of 7\u201313 days after illness onset is the critical stage in the COVID-19 course. Age and male gender were independent risk factors for death of COVID-19.",
      "Disentangling Interactions in the Microbiome: A Network Perspective Microbiota are now widely recognized as being central players in the health of all organisms and ecosystems, and subsequently have been the subject of intense study. However, analyzing and converting microbiome data into meaningful biological insights remain very challenging. In this review, we highlight recent advances in network theory and their applicability to microbiome research. We discuss emerging graph theoretical concepts and approaches used in other research disciplines and demonstrate how they are well suited for enhancing our understanding of the higher-order interactions that occur within microbiomes. Network-based analytical approaches have the potential to help disentangle complex polymicrobial and microbe\u2013host interactions, and thereby further the applicability of microbiome research to personalized medicine, public health, environmental and industrial applications, and agriculture."

      "Radiological approach to COVID-19 pneumonia with an emphasis on chest CT Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has recently become a worldwide outbreak with several millions of people infected and more than 160.000 deaths. A fast and accurate diagnosis in this outbreak is critical to isolate and treat patients. Radiology plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of the patients. Among various imaging modalities, chest CT has received attention with its higher sensitivity and specificity rates. Shortcomings of the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test, including inappropriate sample collection and analysis methods, initial false negative results, and limited availability has led to widespread use of chest CT in the diagnostic algorithm. This review summarizes the role of radiology in COVID-19 pneumonia, diagnostic accuracy of imaging, and chest CT findings of the disease.",
      "TGEV corona virus ORF4 encodes a membrane protein that is incorporated into virions Abstract The coding potential of the open reading frame ORF4 (82 amino acids) of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) has been confirmed by expression using a baculovirus vector. Five monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised against the 10K recombinant product immunoprecipitated a polypeptide of a similar size in TGEV-infected cells. Immunofluorescence assays performed both on insect and mammalian cells revealed that ORF4 was a membrane-associated protein, a finding consistent with the prediction of a membrane-spanning segment in ORF4 sequence. Two epitopes were localized within the last 21 C-terminal residues of the sequence through peptide scanning and analysis of the reactivity of a truncated ORF4 recombinant protein. Since the relevant MAbs were found to induce a cell surface fluorescence, these data suggest that ORF4 may be an integral membrane protein having a Cexo-Nendo orientation. Anti-ORF4 MAbs were also used to show that ORF4 polypeptide may be detected in TGEV virion preparations, with an estimated number of 20 molecules incorporated per particle. Comparison of amino acid sequence data provided strong evidence that other coronaviruses encode a polypeptide homologous to TGEV ORF4. Our results led us to propose that ORF4 represents a novel minor structural polypeptide, tentatively designated SM (small membrane protein).",
      "Proliferative and nonproliferative lesions of the rat and mouse hepatobiliary system. The INHAND Project (International Harmonization of Nomenclature and Diagnostic Criteria for Lesions in Rats and Mice) is a joint initiative of the Societies of Toxicologic Pathology from Europe (ESTP), Great Britain (BSTP), Japan (JSTP) and North America (STP) to develop an internationally-accepted nomenclature for proliferative and non-proliferative lesions in laboratory animals. The purpose of this publication is to provide a standardized nomenclature and differential diagnosis for classifying microscopic lesions observed in the hepatobiliary system of laboratory rats and mice, with color microphotographs illustrating examples of some lesions. The standardized nomenclature presented in this document is also available for society members electronically on the internet (http://goreni.org). Sources of material included histopathology databases from government, academia, and industrial laboratories throughout the world. Content includes spontaneous and aging lesions as well as lesions induced by exposure to test materials. A widely accepted and utilized international harmonization of nomenclature for lesions of the hepatobiliary system in laboratory animals will decrease confusion among regulatory and scientific research organizations in different countries and provide a common language to increase and enrich international exchanges of information among toxicologists and pathologists.",
      "Dissemination and co-circulation of SARS-CoV2 subclades exhibiting enhanced transmission associated with increased mortality in Western Europe and the United States Mechanisms underlying the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like clinical manifestations leading to deaths in patients who develop COVID-19 remain uncharacterized. While multiple factors could influence these clinical outcomes, we explored if differences in transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV2 variants could contribute to these terminal clinical consequences of COVID-19. We analyzed 34,412 SARS-CoV2 sequences deposited in the Global Initiative for Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) SARS-CoV2 sequence database to determine if regional differences in circulating strain variants correlated with increased mortality in Europe, the United States, and California. We found two subclades descending from the Wuhan HU-1 strain that rapidly became dominant in Western Europe and the United States. These variants contained nonsynonymous nucleotide mutations in the Orf1ab segment encoding RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (C14408T), the spike protein gene (A23403G), and Orf1a (G25563T), which resulted in non-conservative amino acid substitutions P323L, D614G, and Q57H, respectively. In Western Europe, the A23403G-C14408T subclade dominated, while in the US, the A23403G-C14408T-G25563T mutant became the dominant strain in New York and parts of California. The high cumulative frequencies of both subclades showed inconsistent but significant association with high cumulative CFRs in some of the regions. When the frequencies of the subclades were analyzed by their 7-day moving averages across each epidemic, we found co-circulation of both subclades to temporally correlate with peak mortality periods. We postulate that in areas with high numbers of these co-circulating subclades, a person may get serially infected. The second infection may trigger a hyperinflammatory response similar to the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) response, which could explain the ARDS-like manifestations observed in people with co-morbidity, who may not mount sufficient levels of neutralizing antibodies against the first infection. Further studies are necessary but the implication of such a mechanism will need to be considered for all current COVID-19 vaccine designs.",
      "Drug repurposing using computational methods to identify therapeutic options for COVID-19 PURPOSE: Recently, the world has been dealing with a new type of coronavirus called COVID-19 that in terms of symptoms is similar to the SARS coronavirus. Unfortunately, researchers could not find a registered therapy to treat the infection related to the virus yet. Regarding the fact that drug repurposing is a good strategy for epidemic viral infection, we applied the drug repurposing strategy using virtual screening to identify therapeutic options for COVID-19. For this purpose, five proteins of COVID-19 (3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), Papain-Like protease (PLpro), cleavage site, HR1 and RBD in Spike protein) were selected as target proteins for drug repositioning. METHODS: First, five proteins of COVID-19 were built by homology modeling. Then FDA-approved drugs (2471 drugs) were screened against cleavage site and RBD in Spike protein via virtual screening. One hundred and twenty-eight FDA-approved drugs with the most favorable free-binding energy were attached to the cleavage site and RBD in Spike protein. Of these 128 drugs, 18 drugs have either been used currently as antiviral or have been reported to possess antiviral effects. Virtual screening was then performed for the 18 selected drugs with ACE2, 3CLpro and PLpro and HR1 and TMPRSS2. RESULTS: According to the results, glecaprevir, paritaprevir, simeprevir, ledipasvir, glycyrrhizic acid, TMC-310911, and hesperidin showed highly favorably free binding energies with all tested target proteins. CONCLUSION: The above-mentioned drugs can be regarded as candidates to treat COVID-19 infections, but further study on the efficiency of these drugs is also necessary.",
      "The role of MRI in the early evaluation of lung microwave ablation. PURPOSE To retrospectively investigate the role of a contrast enhanced MRI (ceMRI) performed 24 h after a microwave ablation (MWA) of the lung, in predicting local tumour progression (LTP) and detecting complications compared to an unenhanced CT. MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty-nine patients who underwent MWA of 77 lung metastases between 2008 and 2015 were included. All patients received an unenhanced chest CT and a ceMRI (including T2 and ceT1) 24 h after MWA. The conspicuities of the peripheral rim and the ablated tumour were scored using 1-3 scales and compared between examinations. The safety margin was measured directly (both scores \u22652) and indirectly using a subtraction method. The ability of each imaging modality to predict LTP based on safety margin width was analysed using receiver operating characteristic curves. The MRI ability to detect a pneumothorax was compared to CT. RESULTS The peripheral rim was best visualised on T2 followed by T1 and CT. The tumour was best visualised on CT, followed by T1 and T2. Direct safety margin measurement was possible on CT, ceT1 and T2 in 68.8%, 64.9% and 27.3% of cases, respectively. Direct CT (AUC = 0.77) and ceT1 (AUC = 0.76) measurements had better diagnostic performance than indirect CT (AUC = 0.72), ceT1 (AUC = 0.70) and T2 (AUC = 0.69) measurements. The MRI sensitivity and specificity for pneumothorax were 60.8% and 87.0%, respectively. Only one pneumothorax >1 cm was missed. CONCLUSIONS A ceMRI performed 24 h after MWA of lung tumours has a similar ability to predict LTP and detect important complications as a CT has.",
      "Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA identified in Eastern India: Possible implications for the ongoing outbreak in India and impact on viral structure and host susceptibility. Direct massively parallel sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genome was undertaken from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples of infected individuals in Eastern India. Seven of the isolates belonged to the A2a clade, while one belonged to the B4 clade. Specific mutations, characteristic of the A2a clade, were also detected, which included the P323L in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and D614G in the Spike glycoprotein. Further, our data revealed emergence of novel subclones harbouring nonsynonymous mutations, viz. G1124V in Spike (S) protein, R203K, and G204R in the nucleocapsid (N) protein. The N protein mutations reside in the SR-rich region involved in viral capsid formation and the S protein mutation is in the S2 domain, which is involved in triggering viral fusion with the host cell membrane. Interesting correlation was observed between these mutations and travel or contact history of COVID-19 positive cases. Consequent alterations of miRNA binding and structure were also predicted for these mutations. More importantly, the possible implications of mutation D614G (in SD domain) and G1124V (in S2 subunit) on the structural stability of S protein have also been discussed. Results report for the first time a bird's eye view on the accumulation of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome in Eastern India.",
      "In silico multi-epitope vaccine against covid19 showing effective interaction with HLA-B*15:03 The recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV)-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease (covid19) has posed a great threat to human health. Previous outbreaks of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) from the same CoV family had posed similar threat to human health and economic growth. To date, not even a single drug specific to any of these CoVs has been developed nor any anti-viral vaccine is available for the treatment of diseases caused by CoVs. Subunits present in spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are involved in binding to human ACE2 Receptor which is the primary method of viral invasion. As it has been observed in the previous studies that there are very minor differences in the spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 has an additional furin cleavage site that makes it different from SARS-CoV (Walls et al., 2020). In this study, we have analyzed spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV phylogenetically and subjected them to selection pressure analysis. Selection pressure analysis has revealed some important sites in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike glycoproteins that might be involved in their pathogenicity. Further, we have developed a potential multi-epitope vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing its interactions with HLA-B*15:03 subtype. This vaccine consists of multiple T-helper (TH) cells, B-cells, and Cytotoxic T-cells (CTL) epitopes joined by linkers and an adjuvant to increase its immunogenicity. Conservation of selected epitopes in SARS, MERS, and human hosts, suggests that the designed vaccine could provide cross-protection.

The vaccine candidate that we have designed as a result of this work shows promising result indicating its potential capability of simulating an immune response.",
      "Crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of the heptad\u2010repeat complex of SARS coronavirus spike protein The aetiological agent of an emergent outbreak of atypical pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), is a positive\u2010stranded RNA virus (SARS\u2010CoV) belonging to the Coronaviridae family with a genome that differs substantially from those of other known coronaviruses. Highly conserved heptad\u2010repeat (HR1 and HR2) regions in class I viral fusion proteins, including spike protein from SARS coronavirus, interact with each other to form a six\u2010helix bundle, which is called a fusion core. The crystal structure of the fusion core is expected to greatly facilitate drug design. Crystals of the fusion core of SARS\u2010CoV spike protein have been grown at 291 K using PEG 4000 as precipitant. The diffraction pattern of the crystal extends to 2.8 \u00c5 resolution at 100 K in\u2010house. The crystals have unit\u2010cell parameters a = 121.2, b = 66.3, c = 70.0 \u00c5, \u03b1 = \u03b3 = 90, \u03b2 = 107.4\u00b0 and belong to space group C2. Assuming the presence of six molecules per asymmetric unit, the solvent content is estimated to be about 28%.",
      "Use of high flow nasal cannula in critically ill infants, children, and adults: a critical review of the literature. BACKGROUND High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) systems utilize higher gas flow rates than standard nasal cannulae. The use of HFNC as a respiratory support modality is increasing in the infant, pediatric, and adult populations as an alternative to non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. OBJECTIVES This critical review aims to: (1) appraise available evidence with regard to the utility of HFNC in neonatal, pediatric, and adult patients; (2) review the physiology of HFNC; (3) describe available HFNC systems (online supplement); and (4) review ongoing and planned trials studying the utility of HFNC in various clinical settings. RESULTS Clinical neonatal studies are limited to premature infants. Only a few pediatric studies have examined the use of HFNC, with most focusing on this modality for viral bronchiolitis. In critically ill adults, most studies have focused on acute respiratory parameters and short-term physiologic outcomes with limited investigations focusing on clinical outcomes such as duration of therapy and need for escalation of ventilatory support. Current evidence demonstrates that HFNC generates positive airway pressure in most circumstances; however, the predominant mechanism of action in relieving respiratory distress is not well established. CONCLUSION Current evidence suggests that HFNC is well tolerated and may be feasible in a subset of patients who require ventilatory support with non-invasive ventilation. However, HFNC has not been demonstrated to be equivalent or superior to non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, and further studies are needed to identify clinical indications for HFNC in patients with moderate to severe respiratory distress."

      "Comprehensive overview of COVID-19 based on current evidence In December 2019, twenty-seven pneumonia patients with unknown causes originated in South China seafood market in Wuhan. The virus infection spread rapidly and swept through China in less than a month. Subsequently, the virus was proven a novel coronavirus and named SARS-CoV-2. The outbreak of novel coronavirus has been determined as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by WHO on January 31, 2020. Similar to other coronaviruses like the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoV and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) CoV, the novel coronavirus was reported to spread via respiratory droplets and close contact from human to human, which means the virus is highly infectious and dangerous. Unfortunately, till now the virus has spread to over 200 countries/territories/areas around the world and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is continuing to grow. Currently, information sharing and transparency are essential for risk assessment and epidemic control in all endemic areas. In this article, we compared SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV and influenza virus, discussed current researching progress of COVID-19, including clinical characteristics, pathological changes, treatment measures, and so on.",
      "Identification and interspecies transmission of a novel bocaparvovirus among different bat species in China. We report the discovery of a novel bocaparvovirus, bat bocaparvovirus (BtBoV), in one spleen, four respiratory and 61 alimentary samples from bats of six different species belonging to three families, Hipposideridae, Rhinolophidae and Vespertilionidae. BtBoV showed a higher detection rate in alimentary samples of Rhinolophus sinicus (5.7 %) than those of other bat species (0.43-1.59 %), supporting R. sinicus as the primary reservoir and virus spillover to accidental bat species. BtBoV peaked during the lactating season of R. sinicus, and it was more frequently detected among female than male adult bats (P<0.05), and among lactating than non-lactating female bats (P<0.0001). Positive BtBoV detection was associated with lower body weight in lactating bats (P<0.05). Ten nearly complete BtBoV genomes from three bat species revealed a unique large ORF1 spanning NS1 and NP1 in eight genomes and conserved splicing signals leading to multiple proteins, as well as a unique substitution in the conserved replication initiator motif within NS1. BtBoV was phylogenetically distantly related to known bocaparvoviruses with \u226457.3 % genome identities, supporting BtBoV as a novel species. Ms-BtBoV from Miniopterus schreibersii and Hp-BtBoV from Hipposideros pomona demonstrated 97.2-99.9 % genome identities with Rs-BtBoVs from R. sinicus, supporting infection of different bat species by a single BtBoV species. Rs-BtBoV_str15 represents the first bat parvovirus genome with non-coding regions sequenced, which suggested the presence of head-to-tail genomic concatamers or episomal forms of the genome. This study represents the first to describe interspecies transmission in BoVs. The high detection rates in lactating female and juvenile bats suggest possible vertical transmission of BtBoV.",
      "The SARS, MERS and novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemics, the newest and biggest global health threats: what lessons have we learned? OBJECTIVES: To provide an overview of the three major deadly coronaviruses and identify areas for improvement of future preparedness plans, as well as provide a critical assessment of the risk factors and actionable items for stopping their spread, utilizing lessons learned from the first two deadly coronavirus outbreaks, as well as initial reports from the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic in Wuhan, China. METHODS: Utilizing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA) website, and a comprehensive review of PubMed literature, we obtained information regarding clinical signs and symptoms, treatment and diagnosis, transmission methods, protection methods and risk factors for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19. Comparisons between the viruses were made. RESULTS: Inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation, and limited reporting on the virus within China has, in part, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout mainland China and into proximal and distant countries. Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due in part to increased globalization and the focus of the epidemic. Wuhan, China is a large hub connecting the North, South, East and West of China via railways and a major international airport. The availability of connecting flights, the timing of the outbreak during the Chinese (Lunar) New Year, and the massive rail transit hub located in Wuhan has enabled the virus to perforate throughout China, and eventually, globally. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that we did not learn from the two prior epidemics of coronavirus and were ill-prepared to deal with the challenges the COVID-19 epidemic has posed. Future research should attempt to address the uses and implications of internet of things (IoT) technologies for mapping the spread of infection.",

      "Monophyletic Relationship between Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus and Group 2 Coronaviruses Although primary genomic analysis has revealed that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) is a new type of coronavirus, the different protein trees published in previous reports have provided no conclusive evidence indicating the phylogenetic position of SARS CoV. To clarify the phylogenetic relationship between SARS CoV and other coronaviruses, we compiled a large data set composed of 7 concatenated protein sequences and performed comprehensive analyses, using the maximum-likelihood, Bayesian-inference, and maximum-parsimony methods. All resulting phylogenetic trees displayed an identical topology and supported the hypothesis that the relationship between SARS CoV and group 2 CoVs is monophyletic. Relationships among all major groups were well resolved and were supported by all statistical analyses.",

      "Amino acids from both N-terminal hydrophobic regions of the Lassa virus envelope glycoprotein GP-2 are critical for pH-dependent membrane fusion and infectivity. Lassa virus glycoprotein 2 (LASV GP-2) belongs to the class I fusion protein family. Its N terminus contains two stretches of highly conserved hydrophobic amino acids (residues 260-266 and 276-298) that have been proposed as N-terminal or internal fusion peptide segments (N-FPS, I-FPS) by analogy with similar sequences of other viral glycoproteins or based on experimental data obtained with synthetic peptides, respectively. By using a pH-dependent, recombinant LASV glycoprotein mediated cell-cell fusion assay and a retroviral pseudotype infectivity assay, an alanine scan of all hydrophobic amino acids within both proposed FPSs was performed. Fusogenicity and infectivity were correlated, both requiring correct processing of the glycoprotein precursor. Most point mutations in either FPS accounted for reduced or abolished fusion or infection, respectively. Some mutations also had an effect on pre-fusion steps of virus entry, possibly by inducing structural changes in the glycoprotein. The data demonstrate that several amino acids from both hydrophobic regions of the N terminus, some of which (W264, G277, Y278 and L280) are 100 % conserved in all arenaviruses, are involved in fusogenicity and infectivity of LASV GP-2.",
      "Preliminary evidence that higher temperatures are associated with lower incidence of COVID-19, for cases reported globally up to 29th February 2020 Seasonal variation in COVID-19 incidence could impact the trajectory of the pandemic. Using global line-list data on COVID-19 cases reported until 29th February 2020 and global gridded temperature data, and after adjusting for surveillance capacity and time since first imported case, higher average temperature was strongly associated with lower COVID-19 incidence for temperatures of 1\u00b0C and higher. However, temperature explained a relatively modest amount of the total variation in COVID-19 incidence. These preliminary findings support stringent containment efforts in Europe and elsewhere.",

      "Interventions to prevent transmission of the common cold Theoretically, there are several ways of preventing the common cold: quarantine, immunisation (or vaccination); early treatment of effected individuals; or physical barriers to reduce transmission. All these methods can be dismissed after considering the epidemiology of the common cold, apart from the last. Evidence for effectiveness for physical barriers (which include masks to reduce aerosol transmission; handwashing; and gloves and gowns) come from a variety of empirical studies. The chance of bias for these studies is variable, but we can conclude that all of these barrier methods have important potential for preventing transmission of the common cold, although some methods will not be acceptable to the community currently.",

      "Aerosol Filtration Efficiency of Common Fabrics Used in Respiratory Cloth Masks The emergence of a pandemic affecting the respiratory system can result in a significant demand for face masks. This includes the use of cloth masks by large sections of the public, as can be seen during the current global spread of COVID-19. However, there is limited knowledge available on the performance of various commonly available fabrics used in cloth masks. Importantly, there is a need to evaluate filtration efficiencies as a function of aerosol particulate sizes in the 10 nm to 10 \u00b5m range, which is particularly relevant for respiratory virus transmission. We have carried out these studies for several common fabrics including cotton, silk, chiffon, flannel, various synthetics, and their combinations. Although the filtration efficiencies for various fabrics when a single layer was used ranged from 5 to 80% and 5 to 95% for particle sizes of <300 nm and >300 nm, respectively, the efficiencies improved when multiple layers were used and when using a specific combination of different fabrics. Filtration efficiencies of the hybrids (such as cotton-silk, cotton-chiffon, cotton-flannel) was >80% (for particles <300 nm) and >90% (for particles >300 nm). We speculate that the enhanced performance of the hybrids is likely due to the combined effect of mechanical and electrostatic-based filtration. Cotton, the most widely used material for cloth masks performs better at higher weave densities (i.e., thread count) and can make a significant difference in filtration efficiencies. Our studies also imply that gaps (as caused by an improper fit of the mask) can result in over a 60% decrease in the filtration efficiency, implying the need for future cloth mask design studies to take into account issues of \"fit\" and leakage, while allowing the exhaled air to vent efficiently. Overall, we find that combinations of various commonly available fabrics used in cloth masks can potentially provide significant protection against the transmission of aerosol particles.",
      "Managing Urology Consultations during COVID-19 Pandemic: Application of a Structured Care Pathway Abstract Objectives To describe and evaluate a risk-stratified triage pathway for inpatient urology consultations during the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. This pathway seeks to outline a urology patient care strategy that reduces the transmission risk to both healthcare providers and patients, reduces the healthcare burden, and maintains appropriate patient care. Methods Consultations to the urology service during a three-week period (March 16 to April 2, 2020) were triaged and managed via one of three pathways: Standard, Telemedicine, or High-Risk. Standard consults were in-person consults with non- COVID-19 patients, High-Risk consults were in-person consults with COVID-19 positive/suspected patients, and Telemedicine consults were telephonic consults for low-acuity urologic issues in either group of patients. Patient demographics, consultation parameters and consultation outcomes were compared to consultations from the month of March 2019. Categorical variables were compared using Chi-square test and continuous variables using Mann-Whitney U test. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant. Results Between March 16 and April 2, 2020, 53 inpatient consultations were performed. By following our triage pathway, a total of 19/53 consultations (35.8%) were performed via Telemedicine with no in-person exposure, 10/53 consultations (18.9%) were High-Risk, in which we strictly controlled the urology team member in-person contact, and the remainder, 24/53 consultations (45.2%), were performed as Standard in-person encounters. COVID-19 associated consultations represented 18/53 (34.0%) of all consultations during this period, and of these, 8/18 (44.4%) were managed successfully via Telemedicine alone. No team member developed COVID-19 infection. Conclusions During the COVID-19 pandemic, most urology consultations can be managed in a patient and physician safety-conscious manner, by implementing a novel triage pathway.",

Daily Air Quality Index (AQI) values based on available ozone/PM2.5 data in these counties/cities (3/15/2020-5/31/2020) were extracted from US Environmental Protection Agency and World Air Quality Project. In each county/city, total confirmed COVID-19 cases/deaths (5/31/2020) were available from Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, and total population was extracted from US Census Bureau. Random-effects meta-regression was performed using OpenMetaAnalyst. A meta-regression graph depicted COVID-19 prevalence and fatality (plotted as logarithm-transformed prevalence/fatality on the y-axis) as a function of mean ozone/PM2.5 AQI (plotted on the x-axis). Coefficients were not statistically significant for ozone (P = 0.212/0.814 for prevalence/fatality) and PM2.5 (P = 0.986/0.499). Although multivariable analysis had been planned, it was not performed because of non-significant covariates of interest in the univariable model. In conclusion, ozone/PM2.5 may be unassociated with COVID-19 prevalence/fatality.",
      "Walking Training Enhances Corticospinal Excitability in Progressive Multiple Sclerosis-A Pilot Study. Background: Inflammatory lesions and neurodegeneration lead to motor, cognitive, and sensory impairments in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Accumulation of disability is at least partially due to diminished capacity for neuroplasticity within the central nervous system. Aerobic exercise is a potentially important intervention to enhance neuroplasticity since it causes upregulation of neurotrophins and enhances corticospinal excitability, which can be probed using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Whether people with progressive MS who have accumulated substantial disability could benefit from walking rehabilitative training to enhance neuroplasticity is not known. Objective: We aimed to determine whether 10 weeks of task-specific walking training would affect corticospinal excitability over time (pre, post, and 3-month follow-up) among people with progressive MS who required walking aids. Results: Eight people with progressive MS (seven female; 29-74 years old) with an Expanded Disability Status Scale of 6-6.5 underwent harness-supported treadmill walking training in a temperature controlled room at 16\u00b0C (10 weeks; three times/week; 40 min at 40-65% heart rate reserve). After training, there was significantly higher corticospinal excitability in both brain hemispheres, reductions in TMS active motor thresholds, and increases in motor-evoked potential amplitudes and slope of the recruitment curve (REC). Decreased intracortical inhibition (shorter cortical silent period) after training was noted in the hemisphere corresponding to the stronger hand only. These effects were not sustained at follow-up. There was a significant relationship between increases in corticospinal excitability (REC, area under the curve) in the hemisphere corresponding to the stronger hand and lessening of both intensity and impact of fatigue on activities of daily living (Fatigue Severity Scale and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, respectively). Conclusion: Our pilot results support that vigorous treadmill training can potentially improve neuroplastic potential and mitigate symptoms of the disease even among people who have accumulated substantial disability due to MS.",

      "Surgical mask partition reduces the risk of non-contact transmission in a golden Syrian hamster model for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is believed to be mostly transmitted by medium-to-large sized respiratory droplets although airborne transmission is theoretically possible in healthcare settings involving aerosol-generating procedures. Exposure to respiratory droplets can theoretically be reduced by surgical mask usage. However, there is a lack of experimental evidence supporting surgical mask usage for prevention of COVID-19. METHODS: We used a well-established golden Syrian hamster SARS-CoV-2 model. We placed SARS-CoV-2-challenged index hamsters and na\u00efve hamsters into closed system units each comprising two different cages separated by a polyvinyl chloride air porous partition with unidirectional airflow within the isolator. The effect of a surgical mask partition placed in between the cages was investigated. Besides clinical scoring, hamster specimens were tested for viral load, histopathology, and viral nucleocapsid antigen expression. RESULTS: Non-contact transmission was found in 66.7% (10/15) of exposed na\u00efve hamsters. Surgical mask partition for challenged index or na\u00efve hamsters significantly reduced transmission to 25% (6/24, P=0.018). Surgical mask partition for challenged index hamsters significantly reduced transmission to only 16.7% (2/12, P=0.019) of exposed na\u00efve hamsters. Unlike the severe COVID-19 manifestations of challenged hamsters, infected na\u00efve hamsters had lower clinical scores, milder histopathological changes, and lower viral nucleocapsid antigen expression in respiratory tract tissues. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by respiratory droplets or airborne droplet nuclei in the hamster model. Such transmission could be reduced by surgical mask usage, especially when masks were worn by infected individuals."

This study presents the molecular characterization of chicken astrovirus (CAstV), PL/G059/2014, which is involved in the induction of \u201cwhite chicks\u201d condition. The 7382-nucleotide-long genome sequence was determined by next-generation sequencing using an Illumina MiSeq System. Phylogenetic analysis showed that it has the characteristics that are typical of avian astroviruses. However, overall degree of nucleotide sequence identity was 43.6 % to 73.7 % between PL/G059/2014 and other available genome sequences of aAstV strains. The amino acid sequences of the proteins encoded by ORF1a and ORF1b of the studied strain were very similar (86.5-93.8 % identity) to those of CAstVs 4175 and GA2011, but they were only 32.7-35.2 % identical in the case of ORF2, which is used officially for astrovirus species demarcation. These features could suggest that the PL/G059/2014 strain should be assigned to a new species in the genus Avastrovirus. Moreover, the different phylogenetic topology of PL/G059/2014 and its nucleotide sequence similarity in different genomic regions could suggest that a recombination event occurred during its evolution and that it has ancestors in common with duck astroviruses.",
      "Identification of a Novel Afipia Species Isolated from an Indian Flying Fox An old world fruit bat Pteropus giganteus, held in captivity and suffering from necrosis of its wing digits, failed to respond to antibiotic therapy and succumbed to the infection. Samples submitted to the National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease were tested for viral infection. Vero E6 cells exhibited minor but unique cytopathic effects on second blind passage, and full CPE by passage four. Utilizing an unbiased random amplification technique from cell culture supernatant, we identified a bacterium belonging to the Bradyrhizobiaceae. Purification of cell culture supernatant on TY media revealed a slow growing bacterial isolate. In this study using electron microscopy, 16S rRNA gene analysis and whole genome sequencing, we identify a novel bacterial species associated with the site of infection belonging to the genus Afipia. This genus of bacteria is very diverse, with only a limited number of species characterized. Afipia felis, previously described as the etiological agent to cause cat scratch disease, and Afipia septicemium, most recently shown to cause disease in humans, highlight the potential for members of this genus to form a branch of opportunistic pathogens within the Bradyrhizobiaceae. Increased utilization of next generation sequencing and genomics will aid in classifying additional members of this intriguing bacterial genera.",

      "Live Cell Analysis and Mathematical Modeling Identify Determinants of Attenuation of Dengue Virus 2\u2019-O-Methylation Mutant Dengue virus (DENV) is the most common mosquito-transmitted virus infecting ~390 million people worldwide. In spite of this high medical relevance, neither a vaccine nor antiviral therapy is currently available. DENV elicits a strong interferon (IFN) response in infected cells, but at the same time actively counteracts IFN production and signaling. Although the kinetics of activation of this innate antiviral defense and the timing of viral counteraction critically determine the magnitude of infection and thus disease, quantitative and kinetic analyses are lacking and it remains poorly understood how DENV spreads in IFN-competent cell systems. To dissect the dynamics of replication versus antiviral defense at the single cell level, we generated a fully viable reporter DENV and host cells with authentic reporters for IFN-stimulated antiviral genes. We find that IFN controls DENV infection in a kinetically determined manner that at the single cell level is highly heterogeneous and stochastic. Even at high-dose, IFN does not fully protect all cells in the culture and, therefore, viral spread occurs even in the face of antiviral protection of na\u00efve cells by IFN. By contrast, a vaccine candidate DENV mutant, which lacks 2\u2019-O-methylation of viral RNA is profoundly attenuated in IFN-competent cells. Through mathematical modeling of time-resolved data and validation experiments we show that the primary determinant for attenuation is the accelerated kinetics of IFN production. This rapid induction triggered by mutant DENV precedes establishment of IFN-resistance in infected cells, thus causing a massive reduction of virus production rate. In contrast, accelerated protection of na\u00efve cells by paracrine IFN action has negligible impact. In conclusion, these results show that attenuation of the 2\u2019-O-methylation DENV mutant is primarily determined by kinetics of autocrine IFN action on infected cells.",
      "Isolation and recombinant analysis of variants of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus strains from Beijing, China Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly infectious virus infecting pigs with high morbidity, especially for newborn piglets. Several PEDV strains were isolated from the intestinal tracts of diarrheic piglets from the Beijing area, China. Sequencing of the whole-genome of the PEDV isolates (GenBank numbers MG546687-MG546690) yielded sequences of 28033\u201328038 nt. The phylogenetic tree revealed that these strains from the Beijing area belonged to group II, while the vaccine strain, CV777, belonged to group I. We also determined the genetic correlation between these strains and CV777 strain. However, it showed that these strains in the Beijing area had unique mutations. The sequence identity of PEDV strains showed that these strains are most similar to these strains LZW, CH/JX-1/2013, USAIllinois972013, USAKansas1252014, CH/GDZQ/2014, SHQPYM2013, AJ1102, CHZMDZY11, KoreaK14JB01, and CHYJ130330, respectively.

      "Evaluation of eluents for the recovery of an enveloped virus from hands by whole-hand sampling AIMS: The objective of this research is to evaluate eluents for recovery of an enveloped bacteriophage, \u03a66, using whole-hand sampling. METHODS AND RESULTS: Virus was applied to the hands of volunteers and sampled by the glove juice method with 1.5% beef extract (BE), phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 0.01 and 0.1% Tween 80, tryptic soy broth (TSB), and 9% NaCl. Each volunteer underwent multiple rounds application and hand sampling. Mean log(10) virus loss across trials was 2.6 for BE, 2.8 for PBS, 2.4 for TSB, 3.8 for NaCl, 3.0 for 0.1% Tween 80, and 2.9 for 0.01% Tween 80. Within each volunteer, there was a decline in viral loss from the first to last trial. CONCLUSIONS: These eluents can recover \u03a66 from hands with ~2-3 log(10) loss, comparable to recoveries previously reported for influenza. Protein and detergent-based eluents may have similar recoveries, but recovery may still vary across repeated sampling. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT: Based on current work, protein-based eluents such as beef extract can maximize recovery of enveloped viruses during hand sampling, providing methods for evaluating survival and transmission of enveloped viruses on hands.

We investigated its interactions with 3 chlorine disinfectants to determine if the additive would adversely affect the disinfectants' antimicrobial efficacy or skin safety. METHODS: We tested 0.5% sodium hypochlorite, 0.2% calcium hypochlorite, and 0.5% sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) alone versus with color additive. An independent laboratory tested efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio cholerae, and human coronavirus 229E. An independent laboratory also tested direct skin irritation. RESULTS: Chlorine disinfectants with and without color additive achieved equal levels of efficacy against the tested pathogens. Against S. aureus, 0.5% sodium hypochlorite with and without color additive met Environmental Protection Agency criteria for disinfection success. Against human coronavirus 229E, 0.5% sodium hypochlorite alone failed disinfection success criteria, whereas 0.5% sodium hypochlorite with color additive achieved full viral inactivation (\u22654.50 log(10) reduction). Against V. cholerae, 0.2% calcium hypochlorite alone and with color additive achieved 5.99 log(10) and >6.03 log(10) reductions, respectively. Against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, 0.5% NaDCC with and without color additive achieved >4.9 log(10) and >3.54 log(10) reductions, respectively. All 3 chlorine disinfectants with color additive tested as negligible skin irritants. CONCLUSIONS: This color additive can be combined with chlorine disinfectants without adversely affecting antimicrobial efficacy or skin safety.",
      "Are your hands clean enough for point-of-care electrolyte analysis? Summary Aim To investigate clinically significant analytical interference in point-of-care electrolyte analysis caused by contamination of blood specimens with hand disinfectant. Methods Six different hand hygiene products were added separately to heparinised blood samples in varying amounts as contaminant. The contaminated samples were analysed by three different blood gas and electrolyte analysers for assessing interference on measured whole blood sodium and potassium concentrations. Results There were significant analytical interferences caused by hand hygiene product contamination that varied depending on the combination of disinfectant and analyser. Small amounts of Microshield Antibacterial Hand Gel contamination caused large increases in measured sodium concentration. Such effect was much greater compared with the other five products tested, and started to occur at much lower levels of contamination. There was a trend towards lower sodium results in blood samples contaminated with Hexol Antiseptic Lotion (Hexol), the hand hygiene product that we used initially. Apart from AiE Hand Sanitizer, all the other hand disinfectants, especially Hexol, significantly elevated the measured potassium concentration, particularly when a direct ion-selective electrode method was used for measurement. Conclusion Hand disinfectant products can significantly interfere with blood electrolyte analysis. Proper precautions must be taken against contamination since the resultant errors can adversely affect the clinical management of patients."

      "Respiratory Pathology and Pathogens in Wild Urban Rats (Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus). Norway (Rattus norvegicus) and black rats (Rattus rattus) are common peridomestic species, yet little is known about wild rat ecology, including their natural diseases. We describe gross and histological lesions in the respiratory tract of a sample of 711 wild urban rats. A subset was examined for 19 distinct categories of histological lesions in the respiratory tract. Testing for known respiratory pathogens included serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of lung samples. Grossly evident lesions were rare (8/711; 1%). Upper respiratory tract inflammation was present in 93 of 107 (87%) rats and included rhinitis, submucosal and periglandular lymphoplasmacytic tracheitis, and/or tracheal intraluminal necrotic debris and was significantly associated (P < .05) with the presence of cilia-associated respiratory bacillus (CARB), Mycoplasma pulmonis, and increased body mass (odds ratio [OR] = 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05-1.14 per 10 g). Within the lungs, peribronchiolar and/or perivascular lymphoplasmacytic cuffs were present in 152 of 199 rats (76%) and were also significantly associated (P \u2264 .02) with CARB, M. pulmonis, and increased body mass (OR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.14-1.27 per 10 g). Rats were frequently coinfected with M. pulmonis and CARB, and lesions associated with these pathogens were histologically indistinguishable. Pneumocystis sp was detected in 48 of 102 (47%) rats using PCR but was not significantly associated with lesions. This description of pathology in the respiratory system of wild rats demonstrates that respiratory disease is common. Although the impact of these lesions on individual and population health remains to be investigated, respiratory disease may be an important contributor to wild rat morbidity and mortality.",
      "Is the COVID-19 pandemic masking dengue epidemic in Bangladesh? COVID-19 is now a pandemic. Like other countries, Bangladesh is putting all its efforts to combat this pandemic. Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection causing a severe flu-like illness and, sometimes causing a potentially lethal complication called severe dengue. At this very crisis moment, there are reports on new cases of dengue in Bangladesh. More efforts now need to be taken for the control of dengue along with COVID-19 control measures.",
      "Influencia de la infecci\u00f3n SARS-CoV-2 sobre enfermedades neurodegenerativas y neuropsiqui\u00e1tricas: \u00bfuna pandemia demorada? INTRODUCTION: SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in December 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has since spread across the world. At present, the virus has infected over 1.7 million people and caused over 100 000 deaths worldwide. Research is currently focused on understanding the acute infection and developing effective treatment strategies. In view of the magnitude of the epidemic, we conducted a speculative review of possible medium- and long-term neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with particular emphasis on neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases of neuroinflammatory origin, based on the available evidence on neurological symptoms of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. DEVELOPMENT: We systematically reviewed the available evidence about the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the immediate and lasting effects of the cytokine storm on the central nervous system, and the consequences of neuroinflammation for the central nervous system. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 is a neuroinvasive virus capable of triggering a cytokine storm, with persistent effects in specific populations. Although our hypothesis is highly speculative, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the onset and progression of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases of neuroinflammatory origin should be regarded as the potential cause of a delayed pandemic that may have a major public health impact in the medium to long term. Cognitive and neuropsychological function should be closely monitored in COVID-19 survivors.",
      "A complication of coronavirus disease 2019: delirium COVID-19 is predominantly a respiratory disease. However, some cases exhibit other features including Central Nervous System symptoms. In the older adult, COVID-19 may present with atypical symptoms, including delirium and its complications. The objective of this study is to describe the relationship between the new type of coronavirus infection and delirium. Systematic research (Cochrane Library and PubMed) was carried out (only upper time limit: April 2020). Publications found through this indexed search were reviewed and manually screened to identify relevant studies. Search terms used included \u201cCOVID-19, Delirium, Dementia, Intensive Care Unit\u201d. We manually added articles identified through other sources (i.e., key journals). Older people are at the greatest risk from COVID-19. If infected, they may present delirium. Moreover, it is not exclusive to older people. Delirium is not inevitable; rather, it is preventable. Delirium prevention programs are even more crucial in the era of COVID-19 and cannot be allowed to wither despite the challenges of integrating delirium prevention with COVID-19 care. An acute change in condition, behaviour, or mental status should prompt a delirium screen. As regards the treatment, it is advisable to use non-pharmacological interventions first where possible. Medication may be needed for patients with agitation where there is intractable distress or high risk to self/others.",
      "HATRIC: a study of Pelargonium sidoides root extract EPs\u00ae7630 (Kaloba\u00ae) for the treatment of acute cough due to lower respiratory tract infection in adults\u2014study protocol for a double blind, placebo-controlled randomised feasibility trial BACKGROUND: Acute lower respiratory tract infection is a common acute infection managed in primary care. The current dominant management strategy in the UK is antibiotics, despite widespread publicity regarding antimicrobial resistance and evidence that the small benefits of antibiotics do not outweigh the harms. There is a need to address the rising problem of antibiotic resistance by providing credible alternative strategies, which reduce symptom burden. There is sufficient evidence to recommend the use of Pelargonium sidoides root extract in order to warrant undertaking an independent clinical trial. We propose a feasibility study to demonstrate our ability to recruit and retain patients and conduct a placebo-controlled trial of Pelargonium sidoides extract EPs\u00ae7630 in lower respiratory tract infection where pneumonia is not suspected. Both the tablet and liquid formulations will be included. METHODS: The HATRIC trial is a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled feasibility study aiming to determine the potential to conduct a fully powered trial of Pelargonium sidoides root extract as an alternative to the inappropriate use of antibiotics for acute bronchitis in UK primary care. Primary care sites will be equally randomised to one of two formulation groups (tablet or liquid preparation). Additionally, within each site, patients will be evenly randomised to active or placebo treatment. Antibiotic consumption will be monitored during the trial, but the use of a delayed prescription strategy is encouraged. The target sample size for this study is 160 patients overall or 40 per arm, recruited from approximately 20 primary care sites. The analysis will be descriptive focusing on estimation with no formal comparison of groups taking place. DISCUSSION: If this trial demonstrates the feasibility of recruitment and delivery, we will seek funding for a fully powered placebo-controlled trial of Pelargonium sidoides root extract for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in primary care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: HATRIC was registered on the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN17672884) on 16 August 2018.",
      "The impact of nutrition on COVID-19 susceptibility and long-term consequences Abstract While all groups are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the elderly, underrepresented minorities, and those with underlying medical conditions are at the greatest risk. The high rate of consumption of diets high in saturated fats, sugars, and refined carbohydrates (collectively called Western diet, WD) worldwide, contribute to the prevalence of obesity and type II diabetes, and could place these populations at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 pathology and mortality. WD consumption activates the innate immune system and impairs adaptive immunity, leading to chronic inflammation and impaired host defense against viruses. Furthermore, peripheral inflammation caused by COVID-19 may have long-term consequences in those that recover, leading to chronic medical conditions such as dementia and neurodegenerative disease, likely through neuroinflammatory mechanisms that can be compounded by an unhealthy diet. Thus, now more than ever, wider access to healthy foods should be a top priority and individuals should be mindful of healthy eating habits to reduce susceptibility to and long-term complications from COVID-19.",
      "Cardiac involvement in COVID-19 patients: Risk factors, predictors, and complications: A review BACKGROUND: Respiratory complications have been well remarked in the novel coronavirus disease (SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19), yet an emerging body of research indicates that cardiac involvement may be implicated in poor outcomes for these patients. AIMS: This review seeks to gather and distill the existing body of literature that describes the cardiac implications of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The English literature was reviewed for papers dealing with the cardiac effects of COVID-19. RESULTS: Notably, COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease are counted in greater frequency in intensive care unit settings, and ultimately suffer greater rates of mortality. Other studies have noted cardiac presentations for COVID-19, rather than respiratory, such as acute pericarditis and left ventricular dysfunction. In some patients there has been evidence of acute myocardial injury, with correspondingly increased serum troponin I levels. With regard to surgical interventions, there is a dearth of data describing myocardial protection during cardiac surgery for COVID-19 patients. Although some insights have been garnered in the study of cardiovascular diseases for these patients, these insights remain fragmented and have yet to cement clear guidelines for actionable clinical practice. CONCLUSION: While some information is available, further studies are imperative for a more cohesive understanding of the cardiac pathophysiology in COVID-19 patients to promote more informed treatment and, ultimately, better clinical outcomes.",
      "Rapid identification of uropathogens by combining Alfred 60 system with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry technology Rapid identification of uropathogens is needed to determine appropriate antimicrobial therapy. This study evaluated performance of the Alfred 60 system combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) technology for rapid identification of uropathogens. The Alfred 60 system was used to screen urine cultures, followed by identifying the microbial pathogen in positive cultures using MALDI-TOF MS. The Alfred 60 detected positive cultures by measuring the turbidity of urine samples, which were transferred automatically to vials containing liquid medium and incubated for 3.5 h at 35 \u00b0C in the Alfred 60 system. Vials that showed growth were removed and centrifuged. The pellet was subjected to MALDI-TOF MS identification. In parallel, positive urine samples were inoculated onto agar plates for identification by conventional culture. The time required to detect positive urine cultures with Alfred 60 and identify the uropathogens with MALDI-TOF MS ranged from 15 min to 3.5 h. Among 146 positive urine samples tested, conventional cultures showed three culture groups: group 1 included 101 samples with growth of a single type of microorganism; group 2 included 34 samples with 2 types of microorganisms; and group 3 included 11 samples with &#8805; 3 types of microorganisms. Direct identification by MALDI-TOF MS was concordant with 95% of the samples in group 1, 100% of the principal microorganism in group 2, but could not identify microorganisms in group 3. This combination of methods provides rapid, reliable microbial identification for most positive urine cultures.",
      "N-glycosylation of infectious bronchitis virus M41 spike determines receptor specificity. Infection of chicken coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is initiated by binding of the viral heavily N-glycosylated attachment protein spike to the alpha-2,3-linked sialic acid receptor Neu5Ac. Previously, we have shown that N-glycosylation of recombinantly expressed receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike of IBV-M41 is of critical importance for binding to chicken trachea tissue. Here we investigated the role of N-glycosylation of the RBD on receptor specificity and virus replication in the context of the virus particle. Using our reverse genetics system we were able to generate recombinant IBVs for nine-out-of-ten individual N-glycosylation mutants. In vitro growth kinetics of these viruses were comparable to the virus containing the wild-type M41-S1. Furthermore, Neu5Ac binding by the recombinant viruses containing single N-glycosylation site knock-out mutations matched the Neu5Ac binding observed with the recombinant RBDs. Five N-glycosylation mutants lost the ability to bind Neu5Ac and gained binding to a different, yet unknown, sialylated glycan receptor on host cells. These results demonstrate that N-glycosylation of IBV is a determinant for receptor specificity.",

      "Different pattern of pre-existing SARS-COV-2 specific T cell immunity in SARS-recovered and uninfected individuals Memory T cells induced by previous infections can influence the course of new viral infections. Little is known about the pattern of SARS-CoV-2 specific pre-existing memory T cells in human. Here, we first studied T cell responses to structural (nucleocapsid protein, NP) and non-structural (NSP-7 and NSP13 of ORF1) regions of SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent from COVID-19 (n=24). In all of them we demonstrated the presence of CD4 and CD8 T cells recognizing multiple regions of the NP protein. We then show that SARS-recovered patients (n=23), 17 years after the 2003 outbreak, still possess long-lasting memory T cells reactive to SARS-NP, which displayed robust cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 NP. Surprisingly, we observed a differential pattern of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell immunodominance in individuals with no history of SARS, COVID-19 or contact with SARS/COVID-19 patients (n=18). Half of them (9/18) possess T cells targeting the ORF-1 coded proteins NSP7 and 13, which were rarely detected in COVID-19- and SARS-recovered patients. Epitope characterization of NSP7-specific T cells showed recognition of protein fragments with low homology to \u201ccommon cold\u201d human coronaviruses but conserved among animal betacoranaviruses. Thus, infection with betacoronaviruses induces strong and long-lasting T cell immunity to the structural protein NP. Understanding how pre-existing ORF-1-specific T cells present in the general population impact susceptibility and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is of paramount importance for the management of the current COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Longitudinal immunological analyses reveal inflammatory misfiring in severe COVID-19 patients Recent studies have provided insights into the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1-4. Yet, longitudinal immunological correlates of disease outcome remain unclear. Here, we serially analysed immune responses in 113 COVID-19 patients with moderate (non-ICU) and severe (ICU) disease. Immune profiling revealed an overall increase in innate cell lineages with a concomitant reduction in T cell number. We identify an association between early, elevated cytokines and worse disease outcomes. Following an early increase in cytokines, COVID-19 patients with moderate disease displayed a progressive reduction in type-1 (antiviral) and type-3 (antifungal) responses. In contrast, patients with severe disease maintained these elevated responses throughout the course of disease. Moreover, severe disease was accompanied by an increase in multiple type 2 (anti-helminths) effectors including, IL-5, IL-13, IgE and eosinophils. Unsupervised clustering analysis of plasma and peripheral blood leukocyte data identified 4 immune signatures, representing (A) growth factors, (B) type-2/3 cytokines, (C) mixed type-1/2/3 cytokines, and (D) chemokines that correlated with three distinct disease trajectories of patients. The immune profile of patients who recovered with moderate disease was enriched in tissue reparative growth factor signature (A), while the profile for those with worsened disease trajectory had elevated levels of all four signatures. Thus, we identified development of a maladapted immune response profile associated with severe COVID-19 outcome and early immune signatures that correlate with divergent disease trajectories.",
      "Validation and Comparison of a Modified CDC Assay with two Commercially Available Assays for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Respiratory Specimen Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread rapidly around the globe since it was first identified in December of 2019 in Wuhan, China. In a race to contain the infection, researchers and healthcare officials have developed several assays to help diagnose individuals with COVID-19. To help laboratories in deciding what assay to bring into testing lines, factors such as assay availability, cost, throughput, and TAT should be considered. Here we validated a modified version of the CDC assay and used it as a reference to evaluate the performance of the NeuMoDx\u2122 SARS-CoV-2 and DiaSorin Simplexa\u2122 Covid-19 Direct assays. In silico analysis and clinical sample testing showed that the primesr/probes designed by the CDC were specific to the SARS-CoV-2 as they accurately detected all reactive samples with an assay LoD of 200 copies/ml. The performance of the three assays were analyzed using 161 nasopharyngeal swabs specimen tested within 24 hours or 5 days from routine testing. A 100% agreement was observed between the commercial assays and the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. A deeper look at the Ct values showed no significant difference between NeuMoDx and the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay, whereas DiaSorin had lower overall Ct values than the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. NeuMoDx and DiaSorin workflows were much easier to perform. NeuMoDx has the highest throughput and shortest TAT, whereas although the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay has comparable throughput to DiaSorin, it has the longest hands-on time, and highest TAT.",
      "Evidence for Paralichthys olivaceus IFITM1 antiviral effect by impeding viral entry into target cells Abstract Interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) protein family is novel viral restriction factors with representative transmembrane structure. These proteins also exist in fish, however, their roles in the innate immune response remain unknown. Here, we report a characterization of teleost IFITM1 from flounder Paralichthys olivaceus (PoIFITM1), which exhibits conserved structure characteristic of the IFITM family but comprises a relatively longer N-terminal region. The expression and promoter activity of PoIFITM1 are markedly induced by aquatic animal viruses: Rana grylio virus (RGV) and Scophthalmus maximus rhabdovirus (SMRV). Overexpression and siRNA-mediated knockdown demonstrate that PoIFITM1 exhibits strong antiviral effects against both DNA virus (RGV) and RNA virus (SMRV), expanding the spectrum of viruses inhibited by IFITM proteins. Further analysis shows that PoIFITM1 suppresses viral entry into host cells, confirming that the IFITM-mediated restriction is conserved from lower vertebrates to mammals. Deletion mutagenesis reveals that PoIFITM1 exerts antiviral activity by targeting to Golgi complex and the N-terminal region is required for its subcellular localization, which is not observed in other known IFITM family members. Our current data provide the first evidence that IFITM1 functions as a key effector of the innate immune to restrict virus replication in lower vertebrates, through the action of impeding viral entry.",
      "Pip6-PMO, A New Generation of Peptide-oligonucleotide Conjugates With Improved Cardiac Exon Skipping Activity for DMD Treatment Antisense oligonucleotides (AOs) are currently the most promising therapeutic intervention for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). AOs modulate dystrophin pre-mRNA splicing, thereby specifically restoring the dystrophin reading frame and generating a truncated but semifunctional dystrophin protein. Challenges in the development of this approach are the relatively poor systemic AO delivery and inefficient dystrophin correction in affected non-skeletal muscle tissues, including the heart. We have previously reported impressive heart activity including high-splicing efficiency and dystrophin restoration following a single administration of an arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptide (CPPs) conjugated to a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide (PMO): Pip5e-PMO. However, the mechanisms underlying this activity are poorly understood. Here, we report studies involving single dose administration (12.5 mg/kg) of derivatives of Pip5e-PMO, consecutively assigned as Pip6-PMOs. These peptide-PMOs comprise alterations to the central hydrophobic core of the Pip5e peptide and illustrate that certain changes to the peptide sequence improves its activity; however, partial deletions within the hydrophobic core abolish its efficiency. Our data indicate that the hydrophobic core of the Pip sequences is critical for PMO delivery to the heart and that specific modifications to this region can enhance activity further. The results have implications for therapeutic PMO development for DMD.",
      "Immunologic characterization of a immunosuppressed multiple sclerosis patient that recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection A multiple sclerosis patient infected by SARS-CoV-2 during fingolimod therapy was hospitalized with moderate clinical features, and recovered in 15 days. High levels of CCL5 and CCL10 chemokines and of antibody-secreting B cells were detected, while the levels other B- and T-cell subsets were comparable to that of appropriate controls. However, CD4+ and CD8+ cells were oligoclonally expanded and prone to apoptosis when stimulated in vitro. This study suggests that fingolimod-immunosuppressed patients, despite the low circulating lymphocytes, may rapidly expand antibody-secreting cells and mount an effective immune response that favors COVID-19 recovery after discontinuation.",
      "Clinical Characteristics of Recurrent-positive Coronavirus Disease 2019 after Curative Discharge: a retrospective analysis of 15 cases in Wuhan China In China, the patients with previously negative RT-PCR results again test positive during the post-discharge isolation period. We aimed to determine the clinical characteristics of these recurrent-positive patients. We retrospectively reviewed the data of 15 recurrent-positive patients and 107 control patients with non-recurrent, moderate COVID-19 treated in Wuhan, China. Clinical data and laboratory results were comparatively analyzed. We found that recurrent-positive patients had moderate disease. The rate of recurrent-positive disease in our hospital was 1.87%. Recurrent-positive patients were significantly younger (43(35-54) years) than control patients (60(43-69) years) (P=0.011). The early LOS (length of stay in hospital before recurrence) was significantly longer in recurrent-positive patients (36(34-45) days) than in control patients (15(7-30) days) (P =0.001). The time required for the first conversion of RT-PCR results from positive to negative was significantly longer in recurrent-positive patients (14(10-17) days) than in control patients (6(3-9) days) (P =0.011). Serum COVID-19 antibody levels were significantly lower in recurrent-positive patients than in control patients (IgM: 13.69 {+/-} 4.38 vs. 68.10 {+/-} 20.85 AU/mL, P = 0.015; IgG: 78.53 {+/-} 9.30 vs. 147.85 {+/-} 13.33 AU/mL, P < 0.0001). Recurrent-positive patients were younger than control patients. The early LOS (length of stay in hospital before recurrence) was significantly longer in recurrent-positive group than that in control group. COVID-19 IgM/IgG antibody levels were significantly lower in recurrent-positive group than those in control group, which might explain why the virus RNA RT-PCR was positive after the initial clinical cure(with three times of virus RNA RT-PCR negative). The virus might not be fully eliminated because of the lower IgG level and their later replicating might result in recurrent-positive virus RNA RT-PCR.",
      "Measurement-Based Evaluation Of Google/Apple Exposure Notification API For Proximity Detection in a Commuter Bus We report on the results of a measurement study carried out on a commuter bus in Dublin, Ireland using the Google/Apple Exposure Notification (GAEN) API. This API is likely to be widely used by Covid-19 contact tracing apps. Measurements were collected between 60 pairs of handset locations and are publicly available. We find that the attenuation level reported by the GAEN API need not increase with distance between handsets, consistent with there being a complex radio environment inside a bus caused by the metal-rich environment. Changing the people holding a pair of handsets, with the location of the handsets otherwise remaining unchanged, can cause variations of +/-10dB in the attenuation level reported by the GAEN API. Applying the rule used by the Swiss Covid-19 contact tracing app to trigger an exposure notification to our bus measurements we find that no exposure notifications would have been triggered despite the fact that all pairs of handsets were within 2m of one another for at least 15 mins. Applying an alternative threshold-based exposure notification rule can somewhat improve performance to a detection rate of 5% when an exposure duration threshold of 15 minutes is used, increasing to 8% when the exposure duration threshold is reduced to 10 mins. Stratifying the data by distance between pairs of handsets indicates that there is only a weak dependence of detection rate on distance.",
      "Ebola triage screening and public health: the new \"vital sign zero\". During public health emergencies of international concern such as the 2014 Ebola event, health care leaders need to educate clinicians on the front lines to make uncomfortable, but real triage decisions that focus on optimization of population health outcomes over individual care. Health care workers must consider their own protection first before direct contact with potentially contagious patients. In an era of globalization and emerging infectious disease, routine triage including evaluation of the standard vital signs must shift to include public health considerations with immediate consequences. A new \"vital sign zero\" should be taken at the time of initial patient evaluation to assess for risk and exposure to potentially contagious infectious diseases.",
      "Prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan -implications for the ability to produce long-lasting protective antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Background It is to be determined whether people infected with SARS-CoV-2 will develop long-term immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and retain long-lasting protective antibodies after the infection is resolved. This study was to explore to explore the outcomes of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in four groups of individuals in Wuhan, China. Methods We included the following four groups of individuals who received both COVID-19 IgM/IgG tests and RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 from February 29, 2020 to April 29, 2020: 1470 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from Leishenshan Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, and Wuhan No. 7 Hospital, 3832 healthcare providers without COVID-19 diagnosis, 19555 general workers, and 1616 other patients to be admitted to the hospital (N=26473). COVID-19 patients who received IgM/IgG tests <21 days after symptom onset were excluded. Results IgG prevalence was 89.8% (95% CI 88.2-91.3%) in COVID-19 patients, 4.0% (95% CI 3.4-4.7%) in healthcare providers, 4.6 (95% CI 4.3-4.9 %) in general workers, and 1.0% in other patients (p all <0.001 for comparisons with COVID-19 patients). IgG prevalence increased significantly by age among healthcare workers and general workers. Prevalence of IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was 31.4% in COVID-19 patients, 1.5% in healthcare providers, 1.3% in general workers, and 0.2% in other patients. Conclusions Very few healthcare providers had IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, though a significant proportion of them had been infected with the virus. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, people are unlikely to produce long-lasting protective antibodies against this virus."

      "Characterization of a Novel Chimeric Swine Enteric Coronavirus from Diseased Pigs in Central Eastern Europe in 2016 During a severe outbreak of diarrhoea and vomiting in a pig herd in Central Eastern Europe, faecal samples were tested positive for porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) and negative for transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) using a commercial RT\u2010qPCR assay that can detect both of these coronaviruses. However, further analyses, using other TGEV\u2010 and PEDV\u2010specific RT\u2010qPCR assays, provided results inconsistent with infection by either of these viruses. Sequencing of an amplicon (ca. 1.6 kb), generated by an RT\u2010PCR specific for the PEDV S\u2010gene, indicated a very close similarity (ca. 99% identity) to recently described chimeric viruses termed swine enteric coronaviruses (SeCoVs). These viruses (with an RNA genome of ca. 28 kb) were first identified in Italy in samples from 2009 but have not been detected there since 2012. A closely related virus was detected in archived samples in Germany from 2012, but has not been detected subsequently. Building on the initial sequence data, further amplicons were generated and over 9 kb of sequence corresponding to the 3\u2032\u2010terminus of the new SeCoV genome was determined. Sequence comparisons showed that the three known SeCoVs are \u226598% identical across this region and contain the S\u2010gene and 3a sequences from PEDV within a backbone of TGEV, but the viruses are clearly distinct from each other. It is demonstrated, for the first time, that pigs from within the SeCoV\u2010infected herd seroconverted against PEDV but tested negative in a TGEV\u2010specific ELISA that detects antibodies against the S protein. These results indicate that SeCoV is continuing to circulate in Europe and suggest it can cause a disease that is very similar to PED. Specific detection of the chimeric SeCoVs either requires development of a new diagnostic RT\u2010qPCR assay or the combined use of assays targeting the PEDV S\u2010gene and another part of the TGEV genome.",
      "Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of novel dipeptide-type SARS-CoV 3CL protease inhibitors: Structure\u2013activity relationship study This work describes the design, synthesis, and evaluation of low-molecular weight peptidic SARS-CoV 3CL protease inhibitors. The inhibitors were designed based on the potent tripeptidic Z-Val-Leu-Ala(pyrrolidone-3-yl)-2-benzothiazole (8; K(i) = 4.1 nM), in which the P3 valine unit was substituted with a variety of distinct moieties. The resulting series of dipeptide-type inhibitors displayed moderate to good inhibitory activities against 3CL(pro). In particular, compounds 26m and 26n exhibited good inhibitory activities with K(i) values of 0.39 and 0.33 \u03bcM, respectively. These low-molecular weight compounds are attractive leads for the further development of potent peptidomimetic inhibitors with pharmaceutical profiles. Docking studies were performed to model the binding interaction of the compound 26m with the SARS-CoV 3CL protease. The preliminary SAR study of the peptidomimetic compounds with potent inhibitory activities revealed several structural features that boosted the inhibitory activity: (i) a benzothiazole warhead at the S1\u2032 position, (ii) a \u03b3-lactam unit at the S1-position, (iii) an appropriately hydrophobic leucine moiety at the S2-position, and (iv) a hydrogen bond between the N-arylglycine unit and a backbone hydrogen bond donor at the S3-position.",

      "The dual impact of ACE2 in COVID-19 and ironical actions in geriatrics and pediatrics with possible therapeutic solutions The novel corona virus disease has shaken the entire world with its deadly effects and rapid transmission rates, posing a significant challenge to the healthcare authorities to develop suitable therapeutic solution to save lives on earth. The review aims to grab the attention of the researchers all over the globe, towards the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 disease. ACE2 serves as a molecular target for the SARS-CoV-2, to enter the target cell, by interacting with the viral glycoprotein spikes. However, the complexity began when numerous studies identified the protective response of ACE2 in abbreviating the harmful effects of vasoconstrictor, anti-inflammatory peptide, angiotensin 2, by mediating its conversion to angiotensin-(1\u20137), which exercised antagonistic actions to angiotensin 2. Furthermore, certain investigations revealed greater resistance among children as compared to the geriatrics, towards COVID-19 infection, despite the elevated expression of ACE2 in pediatric population. Based upon such evidences, the review demonstrated possible therapeutic interventions, targeting both the protective and deleterious effects of ACE2 in COVID-19 disease, primarily inhibiting ACE2-virus interactions or administering soluble ACE2. Thus, the authors aim to provide an opportunity for the researchers to consider RAAS system to be a significant element in development of suitable treatment regime for COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Involvement of VCP/UFD1/Nucleolin in the viral entry of Enterovirus A species Abstract Valosin-containing protein (VCP) plays roles in various cellular activities. Recently, Enterovirus A71 (EVA71) infection was found to hijack the VCP protein. However, the mechanism by which VCP participates in the EVA71 life cycle remains unclear. Using chemical inhibitor, RNA interference and dominant negative mutant, we confirmed that the VCP and its ATPase activity were critical for EVA71 infection. To identify the factors downstream of VCP in enterovirus infection, 31 known VCP-cofactors were screened in the siRNA knockdown experiments. The results showed that UFD1 (ubiquitin recognition factor in ER associated degradation 1), but not NPL4 (NPL4 homolog, ubiquitin recognition factor), played critical roles in infections by EVA71. UFD1 knockdown suppressed the activity of EVA71 pseudovirus (causing single round infection) while it did not affect the viral replication in replicon RNA transfection assays. In addition, knockdown of VCP and UFD1 reduced viral infections by multiple human Enterovirus A serotypes. Mechanistically, we found that knockdown of UFD1 significantly decreased the binding and the subsequent entry of EVA71 to host cells through modulating the levels of nucleolin protein, a coreceptor of EVA71. Together, these data reveal novel roles of VCP and its cofactor UFD1 in the virus entry by EVA71.",
      "Total-body irradiation before bone marrow transplantation for acute leukemia in first or second complete remission: Results and prognostic factors in 326 consecutive patients AIM: In order to assess the influence of total-body irradiation (TBI) on the outcome and incidence of complication after bone marrow transplantation (BMT), we retrospectively analyzed our patients treated for acute leukemia and conditioned with TBI prior to BMT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1980 and 1993, 326 patients referred to our department with acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL, n=182) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n=144) in complete remission underwent TBI either in single dose (190 patients: 10 Gy administered to the midplane, and 8 Gy to the lungs [STBI]) or in 6 fractions (136 patients: 12 Gy on 3 consecutive days, and 9 Gy to the lungs [FTBI]) before BMT. The male-to-female ratio was 204/122 (1.67), and the median age was 30 years (mean: 30 \u00b1 11, range: 3 to 63). The patients were analyzed according to 3 instantaneous dose rate groups: 118 patients in the LOW group (\u22640.048 Gy/min), 188 in the MEDIUM group (> 0.048 and \u2264 0.09 Gy/min), and 20 in the HIGH group (> 0.09 cGy/min). Conditioning chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide (CY) alone in 250 patients, CY and other drugs in 54, and 22 patients were conditioned using combinations without CY. Following TBI, allogeneic and autologous BMT were realized respectively in 118 and 208 patients. Median follow-up period was 68 months (mean: 67 \u00b1 29, range: 24 to 130 months). RESULTS: Five-year survival, LFS, RI and TRM rates were 42%, 40%, 47%, and 24%, respectively. Five-year LFS was 36% in the STBI and 45% in the FTBI group (p = 0.17). It was 36% in the LOW group, 42% in the MEDIUM group, and 30% in the HIGH group (p > 0.05). Five-year RI was 50% in STBI, 43% in FTBI, 55% in LOW, 41% in MEDIUM, and 44% in HIGH groups (STBI vs. FTBI, p = 0.48; LOW vs. MEDIUM, p = 0.03: MEDIUM vs. HIGH, p = 0.68). TRM was not influenced significantly by the different TBI techniques. When analyzing separately the influence of fractionation and the instantaneous dose rate either in ANLL or ALL patients, no difference in terms of survival and LFS was observed. Fractionation did not influence the 5-year RI both in ANLL and ALL patients. However, among the patients with ANLL, 5-year RI was significantly higher (58%) in the LOW group than the MEDIUM group (31%, p = 0.001), whereas instantaneous dose rate did not significantly influence the RI in ALL patients. The 5-year TRM rate was significantly higher in allogeneic BMT group both in ANLL (37%) and ALL (37%) patients than those treated by autologous BMT (ANLL: 15%, ALL: 18%: p = 0.002 and 0.02, respectively). The 5-year estimated interstitial pneumonitis (IP) and cataract incidence rates were 22% and 19%, respectively, in all patients. IP incidence seemed to be higher in the HIGH group (46%) than the MEDIUM (19%, p = 0.05) or LOW (25%, p = 0.15) groups. Furthermore, cataract incidence was significantly influenced by fractionation (STBI vs. FTBI, 29% vs. 9%; p = 0.003) and instantaneous dose rate (LOW vs. MEDIUM vs. HIGH, 0% vs. 27% vs. 33%; p < 0.0001). Multivariate analyses revealed that the best factors influencing the survival were 1st CR (p = 0.0007), age \u2264 40 years (p = 0.003), and BMT after 1985 (p = 0.008). The RI was influenced independently only by the remission status (p = 0.0002). On the other hand, the TRM rate was lower in patients who did not experience graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD, p < 0.0001), and in those treated after 1985 (p = 0.0005). GvHD was the only independent factor involved in the development of IP (p = 0.01). When considering the cataract incidence, the only independent factor was the instantaneous dose rate (p = 0.0008). CONCLUSION: The outcome of BMT patients conditioned with TBI for acute leukemia was not significantly influenced by the TBI technique, and TRM seemed to be lower in patients treated after 1985. On the other hand, cataract incidence was significantly influenced by the instantaneous dose rate.",
      "Elderly at time of COronaVIrus disease 2019 (COVID-19): possible role of immunosenescence and malnutrition The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly and unpredictably evolving and the majority of deaths are occurring in older people. A partial description of the magnitude of the scenario is provided by numbers and statistics, which probably underestimate the ongoing tragedy. In the present opinion paper, we have focused our attention on the evidence of the relationship among malnutrition, immunosenescence, and the higher morbidity and mortality in elderly patients. In particular, we propose the intriguing hypothesis that correction of nutritional deficits may attenuate the age-dependent alterations of the innate and adaptive immune system which participate in the increased susceptibility and worse outcome observed in the elderly COVID-19 patients."

      "Toward development of generic inhibitors against the 3C proteases of picornaviruses Development of novel antivirals, which requires knowledge of the viral life cycle in molecular detail, is a daunting task, involving extensive investments, and frequently resulting in failure. As there exist significant commonalities among virus families in the manner of host interaction, identifying and targeting common rather than specific features may lead to the development of broadly useful antivirals. Here, we have targeted the 3C protease of Hepatitis A Virus (HAV), a feco\u2010orally transmitted virus of the family Picornaviridae, for identification of potential antivirals. The 3C protease is a viable drug target as it is required by HAV, as well as by other picornaviruses, for post\u2010translational proteolysis of viral polyproteins and for inhibiting host innate immune pathways. Computational screening, followed by chemical synthesis and experimental validation resulted in identification of a few compounds which, at low micromolar concentrations, could inhibit HAV 3C activity. These compounds were further tested experimentally against the 3C protease of Human Rhinovirus, another member of the Picornaviridae family, with comparable results. Computational studies on 3C proteases from other members of the picornavirus family have indicated that the compounds identified could potentially be generic inhibitors for picornavirus 3C proteases.",
      "Comprehensive overview of COVID-19 based on current evidence In December 2019, twenty-seven pneumonia patients with unknown causes originated in South China seafood market in Wuhan. The virus infection spread rapidly and swept through China in less than a month. Subsequently, the virus was proven a novel coronavirus and named SARS-CoV-2. The outbreak of novel coronavirus has been determined as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by WHO on January 31, 2020. Similar to other coronaviruses like the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoV and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) CoV, the novel coronavirus was reported to spread via respiratory droplets and close contact from human to human, which means the virus is highly infectious and dangerous. Unfortunately, till now the virus has spread to over 200 countries/territories/areas around the world and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is continuing to grow. Currently, information sharing and transparency are essential for risk assessment and epidemic control in all endemic areas. In this article, we compared SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV and influenza virus, discussed current researching progress of COVID-19, including clinical characteristics, pathological changes, treatment measures, and so on.",

      "SARS CoV-2: Recent Reports on Antiviral Therapies Based on Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Darunavir/Umifenovir, Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Favipiravir and Other Drugs for the Treatment of the New Coronavirus. Here we report on the most recent updates on experimental drugs successfully employed in the treatment of the disease caused by SARS CoV-2 coronavirus, also referred to as COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease 19). In particular, several cases of recovered patients have been reported after being treated with lopinavir/ritonavir (which is widely used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection) in combination with the anti-flu drug oseltamivir. In addition, remdesivir, which has been previously administered to Ebola virus patients, has also proven effective in the U.S. against coronavirus, while antimalarial chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir and co-administered darunavir and umifenovir (in patient therapies) were also recently recorded as having anti-SARS CoV-2 effects. Since the recoveries/deaths ratio in the last weeks significantly increased, especially in China, it is clear that the experimental antiviral therapy, together with the availability of intensive care unit beds in hospitals and rigorous government control measures, all play an important role in dealing with this virus. This also stresses the urgent need for the scientific community to devote its efforts to find other more specific antiviral strategies.",
      "The SARS, MERS and novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemics, the newest and biggest global health threats: what lessons have we learned? OBJECTIVES: To provide an overview of the three major deadly coronaviruses and identify areas for improvement of future preparedness plans, as well as provide a critical assessment of the risk factors and actionable items for stopping their spread, utilizing lessons learned from the first two deadly coronavirus outbreaks, as well as initial reports from the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic in Wuhan, China. METHODS: Utilizing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA) website, and a comprehensive review of PubMed literature, we obtained information regarding clinical signs and symptoms, treatment and diagnosis, transmission methods, protection methods and risk factors for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19. Comparisons between the viruses were made. RESULTS: Inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation, and limited reporting on the virus within China has, in part, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout mainland China and into proximal and distant countries. Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due in part to increased globalization and the focus of the epidemic. Wuhan, China is a large hub connecting the North, South, East and West of China via railways and a major international airport. The availability of connecting flights, the timing of the outbreak during the Chinese (Lunar) New Year, and the massive rail transit hub located in Wuhan has enabled the virus to perforate throughout China, and eventually, globally. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that we did not learn from the two prior epidemics of coronavirus and were ill-prepared to deal with the challenges the COVID-19 epidemic has posed. Future research should attempt to address the uses and implications of internet of things (IoT) technologies for mapping the spread of infection.",
      "Comparing the endo-aortic balloon and the external aortic clamp in minimally invasive mitral valve surgery. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to assess the differences in perioperative outcomes and complications between the endo-aortic balloon (EAB) and the external aortic clamp (EAC) during primary elective minimally invasive mitral valve surgery (MIMVS) in a single referral centre by one surgeon. Primary outcomes were cardiopulmonary bypass time (CPB), cross-clamp time (CX) and occurrence of postoperative cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs). Secondary outcomes were other perioperative parameters and complications. METHODS We retrospectively analysed 340 consecutive patients who underwent MIMVS for mitral regurgitation (MR), mitral stenosis or combined regurgitation/stenosis between November 2010 and March 2014 in a single referral centre. In total, 221 patients who underwent an isolated mitral valve repair or isolated mitral valve replacement or repair/replacement combined with an atrial fibrillation (AF)-ablation procedure were included. Patients who had previous cardiac surgery or concomitant tricuspid valve surgery, myxoma or atrial septal defect closure surgery were excluded. RESULTS A total of 57 patients (Group A) underwent MIMVS using the EAC and 164 patients (Group B) were operated using an EAB. Preoperative variables showed a significant difference in poor left ventricular function (LVF, P = 0.18) and moderate LVF (P = 0.019). No significant differences were found in CPB-time, cross-clamp time or postoperative CVA. Furthermore, no significant differences were found in complications, 30-day mortality or postoperative echocardiographical MR gradation. Hospital stay, however, was prolonged in Group A (P = 0.001) and maximum troponin T levels were significantly lower in Group B (P = 0.014). In Group B however, 10 procedures were converted (6%) from EAB to EAC. CONCLUSIONS There is no difference in use between the EAB and the EAC in terms of CPB-time and cross-clamp time, complications or MR gradation at discharge. Use of the EAC showed significantly higher postoperative levels of troponin T, implying more myocardial damage, compared with the EAB. In 6% of the cases however, patients were converted from the EAB to the EAC.",

      "Temperature Decreases Spread Parameters of the New Covid-19 Case Dynamics (1) Background: The virulence of coronavirus diseases due to viruses like SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV decreases in humid and hot weather. The putative temperature dependence of infectivity by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 or covid-19 has a high predictive medical interest. (2) Methods: External temperature and new covid-19 cases in 21 countries and in the French administrative regions were collected from public data. Associations between epidemiological parameters of the new case dynamics and temperature were examined using an ARIMA model. (3) Results: We show that, in the first stages of the epidemic, the velocity of contagion decreases with country- or region-wise temperature. (4) Conclusions: Results indicate that high temperatures diminish initial contagion rates, but seasonal temperature effects at later stages of the epidemy remain questionable. Confinement policies and other eviction rules should account for climatological heterogeneities, in order to adapt the public health decisions to possible geographic or seasonal gradients.",
      "Prevalence and Predictors of Anxiety and Depression Symptoms during the COVID-19 Pandemic and Compliance with Precautionary Measures: Age and Sex Matter Effective management of the global pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (also known as COVID-19), resulted in the implementation of severe restrictions in movement and enforcement of social distancing measures. This study aimed to understand and characterize the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population and to identify risks and protective factors that predict changes in mental health status. In addition, the study investigated compliance with precautionary measures (PM) to halt the spread of the virus. The online anonymous survey collected information on sociodemographic data, compliance with PM, quality of life (QOL), and mental health via the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). A total of 1642 adult participants (71.6% women, 28.4% men) completed the survey in the European island country, Cyprus. A large percentage (48%) reported significant financial concerns and 66.7% significant changes in their QOL. About 41% reported symptoms associated with mild anxiety; 23.1% reported moderate-severe anxiety symptoms. Concerning depression, 48% reported mild and 9.2% moderate-severe depression symptoms. Women, younger age (18-29), student status, unemployment status, prior psychiatric history, and those reporting greater negative impact on their QOL, were at higher risk for increased anxiety and depression symptoms (p < 0.05). The youngest age group and males also reported lower levels of compliance with PM. Higher compliance with PM predicted lower depression scores (p < 0.001) but higher anxiety for measures related to personal hygiene. The results of this study provide important data on the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health and QOL and identify a variety of personal and social determinants that serve as risks and protective factors. Furthermore, it has implications for policy makers demonstrating the need for effective mental health programs and guidance for the implementation of PM as a public health strategy."

      "Critical assessment of complications associated with use of the Pipeline Embolization Device. BACKGROUND The Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) has become an important tool in the treatment of complex cerebrovascular pathology since it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in April 2011. OBJECTIVE To determine the overall complication rate (permanent and transient) associated with the use of this new device from a single institution. METHODS We retrospectively examined a prospectively maintained database of our patients treated with the PED since its availability to the current time. 126 patients (24 men, 102 women; age range 14-83 years, mean 59.8 years) were treated for a total of 137 intracranial aneurysms, one cervical internal carotid artery dissection, one cervical vertebral artery dissection, and one carotid-cavernous fistula with a total of 217 PEDs (1.72 PED/patient). RESULTS A total of 40 complications were experienced by 33 patients in our cohort. Four complications (4/126, 3.2%) in four patients were permanent, resulting in three deaths and one permanent disability. The other 36 complications (28.6%) occurred in 29 patients, all of whom went on to recover completely. The total complication rate associated with the use of the PED was 31.7% (40/126). CONCLUSIONS Despite a low rate of permanent complications associated with the PED in this series, the total complication rate was high. This finding supports the conclusion that this device should be reserved for the most challenging aneurysms. Patients should be advised of this higher rate of transient periprocedural complications.

      "Discovering small-molecule therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly become a global health pandemic. The lack of effective treatments, coupled with its etiology, has resulted in more than 400,000 deaths at the time of writing. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is highly homologous to that of SARS-CoV, the causative agent behind the 2003 SARS outbreak. Based on prior reports, clinicians have pursued the off-label use of several antiviral drugs, while the scientific community has responded by seeking agents against traditional targets, especially viral proteases. However, several avenues remain unexplored, including disrupting E and M protein oligomerization, outcompeting host glycan\u2013virus interactions, interfering with the heparan sulfate proteoglycans\u2013virus interaction, and others. In this review, we highlight some of these opportunities while summarizing the drugs current in use against coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).",

NASBA offers high sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and speed of availability of results, and NASBA would be the most applicable molecular diagnostics for disease surveillance and control.",
      "A Review of SARS-CoV-2 and the Ongoing Clinical Trials The sudden outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, later named SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, which rapidly grew into a global pandemic, marked the third introduction of a virulent coronavirus into the human society, affecting not only the healthcare system, but also the global economy. Although our understanding of coronaviruses has undergone a huge leap after two precedents, the effective approaches to treatment and epidemiological control are still lacking. In this article, we present a succinct overview of the epidemiology, clinical features, and molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. We summarize the current epidemiological and clinical data from the initial Wuhan studies, and emphasize several features of SARS-CoV-2, which differentiate it from SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), such as high variability of disease presentation. We systematize the current clinical trials that have been rapidly initiated after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas the trials on SARS-CoV-2 genome-based specific vaccines and therapeutic antibodies are currently being tested, this solution is more long-term, as they require thorough testing of their safety. On the other hand, the repurposing of the existing therapeutic agents previously designed for other virus infections and pathologies happens to be the only practical approach as a rapid response measure to the emergent pandemic, as most of these agents have already been tested for their safety. These agents can be divided into two broad categories, those that can directly target the virus replication cycle, and those based on immunotherapy approaches either aimed to boost innate antiviral immune responses or alleviate damage induced by dysregulated inflammatory responses. The initial clinical studies revealed the promising therapeutic potential of several of such drugs, including favipiravir, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that interferes with the viral replication, and hydroxychloroquine, the repurposed antimalarial drug that interferes with the virus endosomal entry pathway. We speculate that the current pandemic emergency will be a trigger for more systematic drug repurposing design approaches based on big data analysis.",
      "Transcription factor Sox11b is involved in spinal cord regeneration in adult zebrafish. Adult zebrafish have the ability to recover from spinal cord injury and exhibit re-growth of descending axons from the brainstem to the spinal cord. We performed gene expression analysis using microarray to find damage-induced genes after spinal cord injury, and found that Sox11b mRNA is up-regulated at 11 days after injury. However, the functional relevance of Sox11b for regeneration is not known. Here, we report that the up-regulation of Sox11b mRNA after spinal cord injury is mainly localized in ependymal cells lining the central canal and in newly differentiating neuronal precursors or immature neurons. Using an in vivo morpholino-based gene knockout approach, we demonstrate that Sox11b is essential for locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury. In the injured spinal cord, expression of the neural stem cell associated gene Nestin, and the proneural gene Ascl1a (Mash1a), which are involved in the self-renewal and cell fate specification of endogenous neural stem cells, respectively, is regulated by Sox11b. Our data indicate that Sox11b promotes neuronal determination of endogenous stem cells and regenerative neurogenesis following spinal cord injury in the adult zebrafish. Enhancing Sox11b expression to promote proliferation and neurogenic determination of endogenous neural stem cells after injury may be a promising strategy in restorative therapy after spinal cord injury in mammals.",
      "Antiviral activity of cationic amphiphilic drugs Introduction: Emerging and reemerging viral infections represent a major concern for human and veterinary public health and there is an urgent need for the development of broad-spectrum antivirals. Areas covered: A recent strategy in antiviral research is based on the identification of molecules targeting host functions required for infection of multiple viruses. A number of FDA-approved drugs used to treat several human diseases are cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs) that have the ability to accumulate inside cells affecting several structures/functions hijacked by viruses during infection. In this review we summarized the CADs\u2019 chemical properties and effects on the cells and reported the main FDA-approved CADs that have been identified so far as potential antivirals in drug repurposing studies. Expert commentary: Although there have been concerns regarding the efficacy and the possible side effects of the off-label use of CADs as antivirals, they seem to represent a promising starting point for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral strategies. Further knowledge about their mechanism of action is required to improve their antiviral activity and to reduce the risk of side effects.",

Here, we first studied T cell responses to structural (nucleocapsid protein, NP) and non-structural (NSP-7 and NSP13 of ORF1) regions of SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent from COVID-19 (n=24). In all of them we demonstrated the presence of CD4 and CD8 T cells recognizing multiple regions of the NP protein. We then show that SARS-recovered patients (n=23), 17 years after the 2003 outbreak, still possess long-lasting memory T cells reactive to SARS-NP, which displayed robust cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 NP. Surprisingly, we observed a differential pattern of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell immunodominance in individuals with no history of SARS, COVID-19 or contact with SARS/COVID-19 patients (n=18). Half of them (9/18) possess T cells targeting the ORF-1 coded proteins NSP7 and 13, which were rarely detected in COVID-19- and SARS-recovered patients. Epitope characterization of NSP7-specific T cells showed recognition of protein fragments with low homology to \u201ccommon cold\u201d human coronaviruses but conserved among animal betacoranaviruses. Thus, infection with betacoronaviruses induces strong and long-lasting T cell immunity to the structural protein NP. Understanding how pre-existing ORF-1-specific T cells present in the general population impact susceptibility and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is of paramount importance for the management of the current COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Molecular Basis for ADP-ribose Binding to the Macro-X Domain of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp3 The virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, has a large RNA genome that encodes numerous proteins that might be targets for antiviral drugs. Some of these proteins, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymers, helicase and main protease, are well conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and the original SARS virus, but several others are not. This study examines one of the proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 that is most different, a macrodomain of nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3). Although 26% of the amino acids in this SARS-CoV-2 macrodomain differ from those seen in other coronaviruses, biochemical and structural data reveal that the protein retains the ability to bind ADP-ribose, which is an important characteristic of beta coronaviruses, and potential therapeutic target.",

      "Drug repurposing using computational methods to identify therapeutic options for COVID-19 PURPOSE: Recently, the world has been dealing with a new type of coronavirus called COVID-19 that in terms of symptoms is similar to the SARS coronavirus. Unfortunately, researchers could not find a registered therapy to treat the infection related to the virus yet. Regarding the fact that drug repurposing is a good strategy for epidemic viral infection, we applied the drug repurposing strategy using virtual screening to identify therapeutic options for COVID-19. For this purpose, five proteins of COVID-19 (3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), Papain-Like protease (PLpro), cleavage site, HR1 and RBD in Spike protein) were selected as target proteins for drug repositioning. METHODS: First, five proteins of COVID-19 were built by homology modeling. Then FDA-approved drugs (2471 drugs) were screened against cleavage site and RBD in Spike protein via virtual screening. One hundred and twenty-eight FDA-approved drugs with the most favorable free-binding energy were attached to the cleavage site and RBD in Spike protein. Of these 128 drugs, 18 drugs have either been used currently as antiviral or have been reported to possess antiviral effects. Virtual screening was then performed for the 18 selected drugs with ACE2, 3CLpro and PLpro and HR1 and TMPRSS2. RESULTS: According to the results, glecaprevir, paritaprevir, simeprevir, ledipasvir, glycyrrhizic acid, TMC-310911, and hesperidin showed highly favorably free binding energies with all tested target proteins. CONCLUSION: The above-mentioned drugs can be regarded as candidates to treat COVID-19 infections, but further study on the efficiency of these drugs is also necessary."

      "Estimating the risk of 2019 Novel Coronavirus death during the course of the outbreak in China, 2020 Since the first case of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China, the number of cases continues to grow across China and multiple cases have been exported to other countries. The cumulative number of reported deaths is at 637 as of February 7, 2020. Here we statistically estimated the time-delay adjusted death risk for Wuhan as well as for China excluding Wuhan to interpret the current severity of the epidemic in China. We found that the latest estimates of the death risk in Wuhan could be as high as 20% in the epicenter of the epidemic whereas we estimate it ~1% in the relatively mildly-affected areas. Because the elevated death risk estimates are likely associated with a breakdown of the medical/health system, enhanced public health interventions including social distancing and movement restrictions should be effectively implemented to bring the epidemic under control.",

      "Performance of a rapid molecular multiplex assay for the detection of influenza and picornaviruses. BACKGROUND Multiplex assays are a new strategy for diagnosing respiratory infections. These assays are better than those based on cultures or antigen detection, but few data are available for comparing them to monoplex polymerase chain reactions (PCRs). This study evaluated the performance of the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) Fast assay with reference to 2 real-time PCR assays for detecting type A influenza H1 viruses and human enteroviruses and rhinoviruses. METHODS This was an analysis of nasal swab specimens obtained from 590 outpatients suffering from acute respiratory tract disease between September 2009 and February 2010. RESULTS The RVP Fast assay performed well in less than 4 h for detecting type A influenza H1 viruses, particularly (H1N1)pdm09, and human entero/rhinoviruses, with 95.2% and 90.05% agreement, respectively, when compared to monoplex real-time PCR assays. This multiplex assay also detected at least 1 virus in 69.3% of the specimens and detected multiple infections in 40 samples. CONCLUSIONS The multiplex assay detected clinically important viruses in a single genomic test. It will thus be useful for detecting several viruses causing respiratory tract disorders.",

      "COVID-19 related mortality and spread of disease in long-term care: first findings from a living systematic review of emerging evidence Background: Policy responses to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on long-term care (LTC) require robust and timely evidence on mortality and spread of the disease in these settings. The aim of this living systematic review is to synthesise early international evidence on mortality rates and incidence of COVID-19 among people who use and provide LTC. Methods: We report the initial findings of a living systematic review (CRD42020183557), including studies identified through database searches up to 29 May 2020. We searched seven databases (MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL Plus; Web of Science; Global Health; WHO COVID-19 Research Database; medRxiv) to identify all studies reporting primary data on COVID-19 related mortality and incidence of disease among LTC users and staff. We excluded studies not focusing on LTC. Included primary studies were critically appraised and results on number of deaths and COVID-19 related mortality rates, case fatality rates, and excess deaths (co-primary outcomes), as well as incidence of disease, hospitalisations, and ICU admissions were synthesised narratively. We further included official figures on number of deaths in LTC. Findings: A total of 30 study reports for 27 unique primary studies or outbreak reports were included. Outbreak investigations in LTC facilities found COVID-19 incidence rates of between 0.0% and 71.7% among residents and between 1.5% and 64.0% among staff. Mortality rates varied from 0.0% to 9.9% of all residents at outbreak facilities, with case fatality rates between 0.0% and 33.7%. In included studies, no LTC staff members had died. LTC residents accounted for between 0% (Hong Kong) and 82% (Canada) of COVID-related deaths, according to official figures. Interpretation: Long-term care users have been particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we found wide variation in spread of disease and mortality rates between outbreaks at individual LTC facilities. Further research into the factors determining successful prevention and containment of COVID-19 outbreaks is needed to protect long-term care users and staff.",
      "Efficiency of the Penumbra 5MAX ACE Reperfusion Catheter in Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients. OBJECTIVE This study was performed to investigate whether the Penumbra 5MAX ACE is superior to other Penumbra systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective, single center analysis of patients with acute ischemic stroke with occlusion of the internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery (M1 segment) who underwent endovascular therapy using a Penumbra system. The reperfusion success rate, puncture-to-revascularization time, and number of passes were assessed. Multivariate regression analysis was conducted to evaluate independent factors related to revascularization within 60 minutes. Successful revascularization was defined by a thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score \u22652b. RESULTS The Penumbra 5MAX ACE was used in 24 of the 40 patients (60%). Although the revascularization success rate was similar between patient groups (P = .229), the number of passes was significantly lower (1.5 \u00b1 .8 versus 2.6 \u00b1 1.3, P = .006) and the puncture-to-revascularization time was shorter (50 \u00b1 26 minutes versus 116 \u00b1 69 minutes, P = .002) in patients treated with the Penumbra 5MAX ACE. The Penumbra 5MAX ACE was identified as an independent factor for early revascularization (odds ratio, 5.80; P = .041). Among patients with a premorbid modified Rankin Scale score of 0-1, a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 3 months was observed in 15 of the 19 patients (79%) treated with the Penumbra 5MAX ACE and in 8 of the 16 (50%) who were not (P = .072). CONCLUSION Acute revascularization therapy using the Penumbra 5MAX ACE can achieve rapid successful recanalization and tend to improve clinical outcomes.",
      "A Machine Learning Model Reveals Older Age and Delayed Hospitalization as Predictors of Mortality in Patients with COVID-19 Objective: The recent pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is increasingly causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and significant mortality. We aim here to identify the risk factors associated with mortality of coronavirus infected persons using a supervised machine learning approach. Research Design and Methods: Clinical data of 1085 cases of COVID-19 from 13th January to 28th February, 2020 was obtained from Kaggle, an online community of Data scientists. 430 cases were selected for the final analysis. Random Forest classification algorithm was implemented on the dataset to identify the important predictors and their effects on mortality. Results: The Area under the ROC curve obtained during model validation on the test dataset was 0.97. Age was the most important variable in predicting mortality followed by the time gap between symptom onset and hospitalization. Conclusions: Patients aged beyond 62 years are at higher risk of fatality whereas hospitalization within 2 days of the onset of symptoms could reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients.",

      "Association of diabetes and hypertension with disease severity in covid-19 patients: a systematic literature review and exploratory meta-analysis AIM: The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19), now a worldwide public health concern is associated with varied fatality. Patients with chronic underlying conditions like diabetes and hypertension have shown worst outcomes. The understanding of the association might be helpful in early vigilant monitoring and better management of COVID-19 patients at high risk. The aim of the meta-analysis was to assess the association of diabetes and hypertension with severity of disease. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed and Cochrane until March 31, 2020. Seven studies were included in the meta- analysis, including 2018 CIVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Diabetes was lower in the survivors (OR: 0.56; 95%CI: 0.35-0.90; p=0.017; I2: 0.0%) and non-severe (OR: 1.66; 95%CI: 1.20-2.30; p=0.002; I2: 0.0%) patients. No association of diabetes was found with ICU care. Hypertension was positively associated with death (OR: 0.49; 95%CI: 0.34-0.73; p=0.000; I2: 0.0%), ICU care (OR: 0.42; 95%CI: 0.22-0.81; p=0.009; I2: 0.0%) and severity (OR: 2.69; 95%CI: 1.27-5.73; p=0.01; I2: 52.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that diabetes and hypertension have a negative effect on health status of COVID-19 patients. However, large prevalence studies demonstrating the consequences of comorbid diabetes and hypertension are urgently needed to understand the magnitude of these vexatious comorbidities.",
      "Too Much Information: Assessing Privacy Risks of Contact Trace Data Disclosure on People With COVID-19 in South Korea Introduction: With the COVID-19 outbreak, South Korea has been making contact trace data public to help people self-check if they have been in contact with a person infected with the coronavirus. Despite its benefits in suppressing the spread of the virus, publicizing contact trace data raises concerns about individuals' privacy. In view of this tug-of-war between one's privacy and public safety, this work aims to deepen the understanding of privacy risks of contact trace data disclosure practices in South Korea. Method: In this study, publicly available contact trace data of 970 confirmed patients were collected from seven metropolitan cities in South Korea (20th Jan\u201320th Apr 2020). Then, an ordinal scale of relative privacy risk levels was introduced for evaluation, and the assessment was performed on the personal information included in the contact trace data, such as demographics, significant places, sensitive information, social relationships, and routine behaviors. In addition, variance of privacy risk levels was examined across regions and over time to check for differences in policy implementation. Results: It was found that most of the contact trace data showed the gender and age of the patients. In addition, it disclosed significant places (home/work) ranging across different levels of privacy risks in over 70% of the cases. Inference on sensitive information (hobby, religion) was made possible, and 48.7% of the cases exposed the patient's social relationships. In terms of regional differences, a considerable discrepancy was found in the privacy risk for each category. Despite the recent release of government guidelines on data disclosure, its effects were still limited to a few factors (e.g., workplaces, routine behaviors). Discussion: Privacy risk assessment showed evidence of superfluous information disclosure in the current practice. This study discusses the role of \u201cidentifiability\u201d in contact tracing to provide new directions for minimizing disclosure of privacy infringing information. Analysis of real-world data can offer potential stakeholders, such as researchers, service developers, and government officials with practical protocols/guidelines in publicizing information of patients and design implications for future systems (e.g., automatic privacy sensitivity checking) to strike a balance between one's privacy and the public benefits with data disclosure.",
      "The disease-induced herd immunity level for Covid-19 is substantially lower than the classical herd immunity level Most countries are suffering severely from the ongoing covid-19 pandemic despite various levels of preventive measures. A common question is if and when a country or region will reach herd immunity h. The classical herd immunity level hC is defined as hC=1-1/R0, where R0 is the basic reproduction number, for covid-19 estimated to lie somewhere in the range 2.2-3.5 depending on country and region. It is shown here that the disease-induced herd immunity level hD, after an outbreak has taken place in a country/region with a set of preventive measures put in place, is actually substantially smaller than hC. As an illustration we show that if R0=2.5 in an age-structured community with mixing rates fitted to social activity studies, and also categorizing individuals into three categories: low active, average active and high active, and where preventive measures affect all mixing rates proportionally, then the disease-induced herd immunity level is hD=43% rather than hC=1-1/2.5=60%. Consequently, a lower fraction infected is required for herd immunity to appear. The underlying reason is that when immunity is induced by disease spreading, the proportion infected in groups with high contact rates is greater than that in groups with low contact rates. Consequently, disease-induced immunity is stronger than when immunity is uniformly distributed in the community as in the classical herd immunity level.",

Several studies have elucidated the central role of cardiovascular complications in the disease course. Herein, we provide a concise review of current knowledge regarding the involvement of cardiovascular system in the pathogenesis and prognosis of COVID-19. We summarize data from 21 studies involving in total more than 21,000 patients from Asia, Europe and the USA indicating that severe disease is associated with the presence of myocardial injury, heart failure and arrhythmias. Additionally, we present the clinical and laboratory differences between recovered and deceased patients highlighting the importance of cardiac manifestations. For the infected patients, underlying cardiovascular comorbidities and especially existing cardiovascular disease seem to predispose to the development of cardiovascular complications, which are in turn associated with higher mortality rates. We provide mechanistic insights into the underlying mechanisms including direct myocardial damage by the virus and the consequences of the hyperinflammatory syndrome developed later in the disease course. Finally, we summarize current knowledge on therapeutic modalities and recommendations by scientific societies and experts regarding the cardiovascular management of COVID-19 patients."

People with intellectual disability (ID) are especially vulnerable to the physical, mental and social effects of the pandemic. Cognitive impairments can limit understanding of information to protect them relying on carers to be vigilant on their behalf during quarantine. Restrictions on usual activities are likely to induce mental stress especially among those who are autistic leading to an escalation in challenging behaviours, risk of placement breakdown and increased the use of psychotropic medication. People with ID are vulnerable to exploitation by others where the usual community supports no longer function to protect them. In future pandemics, it is important that lessons are learned from the impacts COVID-19 have on people with ID.

      "Antiproliferative effect of Toona sinensis leaf extract on non\u2013small-cell lung cancer Toona sinensis (TS), which is also known as Cedrela sinensis, belongs to Meliaceae family, the compounds identified from this TS leaves possess a wide range of biologic functions, such as hypoglycemic effects, anti\u2013LDL glycative activity, antioxidant activities, and inhibition of sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus replication. However, their effect against cancer cells is not well explored. In this study, to understand the cytotoxic effect and molecular mechanism stimulated by TSL-1 (TS leaf extract fraction) we employed three different non\u2013small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines: H441 cells (lung adenocarcinoma), H661 cells (lung large cell carcinoma) and H520 cells (lung squamous cell carcinoma). IC50 value was varied between these three cell lines, the least IC50 value was observed in TSL-1\u2013treated H661cells. Exposure of NSCLC cells to TSL-1 caused cell-cycle arrest in subG1 phase and caused apoptosis. Moreover, TSL-1 treatment decreased the cell-cycle regulators; cyclin D1 and CDK4 proteins by up regulating p27 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, the TSL-1\u2013induced apoptosis was further confirmed by cell morphology, subG1 peak accumulation, poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, propidium iodide (PI)-Annexin-V double staining, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay. The decreased Bcl2 protein level was concurrent with an increased Bax protein level in all 3 cell lines. Additionally, the tumoricidal effect of TSL-1 was measured using a xenograft model, after 5 weeks of TSL-1 treatment by various regimen caused regression of tumor. Taken together both these in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that TSL-1 is a potent inhibitor against NSCLC growth and our provoking result suggest that TSL-1 can be a better nutriceutical as a singlet or along with doublet agents (taxane, vinorelbine, and gemcitabine) for treating NSCLC.",

      "Effects of total fat intake on bodyweight in children. BACKGROUND As part of efforts to prevent childhood overweight and obesity, we need to understand the relationship between total fat intake and body fatness in generally healthy children. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of total fat intake on measures of weight and body fatness in children and young people not aiming to lose weight. SEARCH METHODS For this update we revised the previous search strategy and ran it over all years in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid), MEDLINE (PubMed), and Embase (Ovid) (current to 23 May 2017). No language and publication status limits were applied. We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing and unpublished studies (5 June 2017). SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children aged 24 months to 18 years, with or without risk factors for cardiovascular disease, randomised to a lower fat (30% or less of total energy (TE)) versus usual or moderate-fat diet (greater than 30%TE), without the intention to reduce weight, and assessed a measure of weight or body fatness after at least six months. We included prospective analytical cohort studies in these children if they related baseline total fat intake to weight or body fatness at least 12 months later. We duplicated inclusion decisions and resolved disagreement by discussion with other authors. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We extracted data on participants, interventions or exposures, controls and outcomes, and trial or cohort quality characteristics, as well as data on potential effect modifiers, and assessed risk of bias for all included studies. We extracted outcome data using the following time point ranges, when available: RCTs: baseline to six months, six to 12 months, one to two years, two to five years and more than five years; cohort studies: baseline to one year, one to two years, two to five years, five to 10 years and more than 10 years. We planned to perform random-effects meta-analyses with relevant subgrouping, and sensitivity and funnel plot analyses where data allowed. MAIN RESULTS We included 24 studies comprising three parallel-group RCTs (n = 1054 randomised) and 21 prospective analytical cohort studies (about 25,059 children completed). Twenty-three were conducted in high-income countries. No meta-analyses were possible, since only one RCT reported the same outcome at each time point range for all outcomes, and cohort studies were too heterogeneous.For the RCTs, concerns about imprecision and poor reporting limited our confidence in our findings. In addition, the inclusion of hypercholesteraemic children in two trials raised concerns about applicability. Lower versus usual or modified total fat intake may have made little or no difference to weight over a six- to twelve month period (mean difference (MD) -0.50 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.78 to 0.78; 1 RCT; n = 620; low-quality evidence), nor a two- to five-year period (MD -0.60 kg, 95% CI -2.39 to 1.19; 1 RCT; n = 612; low-quality evidence). Compared to controls, lower total fat intake (30% or less TE) probably decreased BMI in children over a one- to two-year period (MD -1.5 kg/m2, 95% CI -2.45 to -0.55; 1 RCT; n = 191; moderate-quality evidence), with no other differences evident across the other time points (two to five years: MD 0.00 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.63; 1 RCT; n = 541; greater than five years; MD -0.10 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.75 to 0.55; 1 RCT; n = 576; low-quality evidence). Lower fat intake probably slightly reduced total cholesterol over six to 12 months compared to controls (MD -0.15 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.24 to -0.06; 1 RCT; n = 618; moderate-quality evidence), but may make little or no difference over longer time periods. Lower fat intake probably slightly decreased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol over six to 12 months (MD -0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.04; 1 RCT; n = 618, moderate-quality evidence) and over two to five years (MD -0.09, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.01; 1 RCT; n = 623; moderate-quality evidence), compared to controls. However, lower total fat intake probably made little or no difference to HDL-C over a six- to 12-month period (MD -0.03 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.02; 1 RCT; n = 618; moderate-quality evidence), nor a two- to five-year period (MD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.04; 1 RCT; n = 522; moderate-quality evidence). Likewise, lower total fat intake probably made little or no difference to triglycerides in children over a six- to 12-month period (MD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.06; 1 RCT; n = 618; moderate-quality evidence). Lower versus usual or modified fat intake may make little or no difference to height over more than five years (MD -0.60 cm, 95% CI -2.06 to 0.86; 1 RCT; n = 577; low-quality evidence).Over half the cohort analyses that reported on primary outcomes suggested that as total fat intake increases, body fatness measures may move in the same direction. However, heterogeneous methods and reporting across cohort studies, and predominantly very low-quality evidence, made it difficult to draw firm conclusions and true relationships may be substantially different. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We were unable to reach firm conclusions. Limited evidence from three trials that randomised children to a lower total fat intake (30% or less TE) versus usual or modified fat intake, but with no intention to reduce weight, showed small reductions in body mass index, total- and LDL-cholesterol at some time points with lower fat intake compared to controls, and no consistent differences in effects on weight, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or height. Associations in cohort studies that related total fat intake to later measures of body fatness in children were inconsistent and the quality of this evidence was mostly very low. Twenty-three out of 24 included studies were conducted in high-income countries, and may not be applicable in low- and middle-income settings. High-quality, longer-term studies are needed, that include low- and middle-income settings and look at both possible benefits and risks.",

      "The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in the precipitation of intimate partner violence Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is a global pandemic and many have been victims of it long before Covid-19. International organizations have documented an increase in IPV reports during the current pandemic, raising awareness of the potential causes for such an increase. Reflecting on risk factors associated with IPV, and the underlying need of the perpetrators to exert control over the victims, it becomes increasingly important to understand how the current policies of social distancing, self-isolation, and lockdown can precipitate episodes of IPV. Furthermore, access to specialized services and health care can be compromised, and health care professionals face new challenges and demands imposed by the pandemic while managing IPV cases. This article begins by examining the main risk factors more commonly associated with IPV in the literature. It proceeds by reflecting on how these risk factors may be exacerbated during the Covid-19 pandemic, which can explain the increased number of reports. Finally, it emphasizes the new challenges faced by health care professionals, while assisting IPV victims during the pandemic and provides possible recommendations on actions to implement during and beyond the Covid-19 pandemic to prevent such cases.",
      "It can be dangerous to take epidemic curves of COVID-19 at face value During an epidemic with a new virus, we depend on modelling to plan the response: but how good are the data? The aim of our work was to better understand the impact of misclassification errors in identification of true cases of COVID-19 on epidemic curves. Data originated from Alberta, Canada (available on 28 May 2020). There is presently no information of sensitivity (Sn) and specificity (Sp) of laboratory tests used in Canada for the causal agent for COVID-19. Therefore, we examined best attainable performance in other jurisdictions and similar viruses. This suggested perfect Sp and Sn 60-95%. We used these values to re-calculate epidemic curves to visualize the potential bias due to imperfect testing. If the sensitivity improved, the observed and adjusted epidemic curves likely fall within 95% confidence intervals of the observed counts. However, bias in shape and peak of the epidemic curves can be pronounced, if sensitivity either degrades or remains poor in the 60-70% range. These issues are minor early in the epidemic, but hundreds of undiagnosed cases are likely later on. It is therefore hazardous to judge progress of the epidemic based on observed epidemic curves unless quality of testing is better understood."

Pediatric coronavirus disease - 19 (COVID-19) infection is relatively mild when compared to adults, and children are reported to have a better prognosis Mortality in children appears rare Clinical features of COVID-19 in children include fever and cough, but a large proportion of infected children appears to be asymptomatic and may contribute to transmission It remains unclear why children and young adults are less severely affected than older individuals, but this might involve differences in immune system function in the elderly and/or differences in the expression/function of the cellular receptor for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) - Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) Laboratory findings and chest imaging may not be specific in children with COVID-19 Diagnosis is by Reverse transcriptase-Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of upper or lower respiratory tract secretions This review additionally considers COVID-19 in immunosuppressed children, and also suggests a management algorithm for the few children who appear to present with life threatening infection, including the potential use of antiviral and immunomodulatory treatment The most significant threat to global child health from SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to be related to COVID 19 in children, but rather the socio-economic consequences of a prolonged pandemic",

      "Detection of antibodies against SARS-Coronavirus using recombinant truncated nucleocapsid proteins by ELISA. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a lifethreatening emerging respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, SARS-CoV. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV is highly antigenic and may be a suitable candidate for diagnostic applications. We constructed truncated recombinant N proteins (N1 [1-422 aa], N2 [1- 109 aa], and N3 [110-422 aa]) and determined their antigenicity by Western blotting using convalescent SARS serum. The recombinants containing N1 and N3 reacted with convalescent SARS serum in Western blotting. However, the recombinant with N2 did not. In ELISA using N1 or N3 as the antigens, positive results were observed in 10 of 10 (100%) SARS-CoV-positive human sera. None of 50 healthy sera gave positive results in either assay. These data indicate that the ELISA using N1 or N3 has high sensitivity and specificity. These results suggest that the middle or C-terminal region of the SARS N protein is important for eliciting antibodies against SARS-CoV during the immune response, and ELISA reactions using N1 or N3 may be a valuable tool for SARS diagnosis.",
      "Cellular response to influenza virus infection: a potential role for autophagy in CXCL10 and interferon-alpha induction Historically, influenza pandemics have arisen from avian influenza viruses. Avian influenza viruses H5N1 and H9N2 are potential pandemic candidates. Infection of humans with the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus is associated with a mortality in excess of 60%, which has been attributed to dysregulation of the cytokine system. Human macrophages and epithelial cells infected with some genotypes of H5N1 and H9N2 viruses express markedly elevated cytokine and chemokine levels when compared with seasonal influenza A subtype H1N1 virus. The mechanisms underlying this cytokine and chemokine hyperinduction are not fully elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrate that autophagy, a tightly regulated homeostatic process for self-digestion of unwanted cellular subcomponents, plays a role in cytokine induction. Autophagy is induced to a greater extent by H9N2/G1, in association with cytokine hyperinduction, compared with H1N1 and the novel pandemic swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 viruses. Using 3-methyladenine to inhibit autophagy and small interfering RNA to silence the autophagy gene, Atg5, we further show that autophagic responses play a role in influenza virus-induced CXCL10 and interferon-\u03b1 expression in primary human blood macrophages. Our results provide new insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of avian influenza viruses.",
      "Clinical and CT features in pediatric patients with COVID-19 infection: Different points from adults PURPOSE: To discuss the different characteristics of clinical, laboratory, and chest computed tomography (CT) in pediatric patients from adults with 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection. METHODS: The clinical, laboratory, and chest CT features of 20 pediatric inpatients with COVID-19 infection confirmed by pharyngeal swab COVID-19 nucleic acid test were retrospectively analyzed during 23 January and 8 February 2020. The clinical and laboratory information was obtained from inpatient records. All the patients were undergone chest CT in our hospital. RESULTS: Thirteen pediatric patients (13/20, 65%) had an identified history of close contact with COVID-19 diagnosed family members. Fever (12/20, 60%) and cough (13/20, 65%) were the most common symptoms. For laboratory findings, procalcitonin elevation (16/20, 80%) should be pay attention to, which is not common in adults. Coinfection (8/20, 40%) is common in pediatric patients. A total of 6 patients presented with unilateral pulmonary lesions (6/20, 30%), 10 with bilateral pulmonary lesions (10/20, 50%), and 4 cases showed no abnormality on chest CT (4/20, 20%). Consolidation with surrounding halo sign was observed in 10 patients (10/20, 50%), ground-glass opacities were observed in 12 patients (12/20, 60%), fine mesh shadow was observed in 4 patients (4/20, 20%), and tiny nodules were observed in 3 patients (3/20, 15%). CONCLUSION: Procalcitonin elevation and consolidation with surrounding halo signs were common in pediatric patients which were different from adults. It is suggested that underlying coinfection may be more common in pediatrics, and the consolidation with surrounding halo sign which is considered as a typical sign in pediatric patients.",
      "Observational Research in Childhood Infectious Diseases (ORChID): a dynamic birth cohort study INTRODUCTION: Even in developed economies infectious diseases remain the most common cause of illness in early childhood. Our current understanding of the epidemiology of these infections is limited by reliance on data from decades ago performed using low-sensitivity laboratory methods, and recent studies reporting severe, hospital-managed disease. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Observational Research in Childhood Infectious Diseases (ORChID) study is an ongoing study enrolling a dynamic birth cohort to document the community-based epidemiology of viral respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in early childhood. Women are recruited antenatally, and their healthy newborn is followed for the first 2 years of life. Parents keep a daily symptom diary for the study child, collect a weekly anterior nose swab and dirty nappy swab and complete a burden diary when a child meets pre-defined illness criteria. Specimens will be tested for a wide range of viruses by real-time PCR assays. Primary analyses involves calculating incidence rates for acute respiratory illness (ARI) and acute gastroenteritis (AGE) for the cohort by age and seasonality. Control material from children when they are without symptoms will allow us to determine what proportion of ARIs and AGE can be attributed to specific pathogens. Secondary analyses will assess the incidence and shedding duration of specific respiratory and gastrointestinal pathogens. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study is approved by The Human Research Ethics Committees of the Children's Health Queensland Hospital and Health Service, the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital and The University of Queensland.

      "Learning Based Methods for Code Runtime Complexity Prediction Predicting the runtime complexity of a programming code is an arduous task. In fact, even for humans, it requires a subtle analysis and comprehensive knowledge of algorithms to predict time complexity with high fidelity, given any code. As per Turing\u2019s Halting problem proof, estimating code complexity is mathematically impossible. Nevertheless, an approximate solution to such a task can help developers to get real-time feedback for the efficiency of their code. In this work, we model this problem as a machine learning task and check its feasibility with thorough analysis. Due to the lack of any open source dataset for this task, we propose our own annotated dataset, (The complete dataset is available for use at https://github.com/midas-research/corcod-dataset/blob/master/README.md) CoRCoD: Code Runtime Complexity Dataset, extracted from online coding platforms. We establish baselines using two different approaches: feature engineering and code embeddings, to achieve state of the art results and compare their performances. Such solutions can be highly useful in potential applications like automatically grading coding assignments, IDE-integrated tools for static code analysis, and others.",
      "Clinical features of pediatric patients with COVID-19: a report of two family cluster cases BACKGROUND: Coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the globe. People of all ages are susceptible to COVID-19. However, literature reports on pediatric patients are limited. METHODS: To improve the recognition of COVID-19 infection in children, we retrospectively reviewed two confirmed pediatric cases from two family clusters. Both clinical features and laboratory examination results of the children and their family members were described. RESULTS: The two confirmed children only presented with mild respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. Both of them had normal chest CT images. After general and symptomatic treatments, both children recovered quickly. Both families had travel histories to Hubei Province. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with COVID-19 are mostly owing to family cluster or with a close contact history. Infected children have relatively milder clinical symptoms than infected adults. We should attach importance to early recognition, early diagnosis, and early treatment of infected children.",
      "The dual impact of ACE2 in COVID-19 and ironical actions in geriatrics and pediatrics with possible therapeutic solutions The novel corona virus disease has shaken the entire world with its deadly effects and rapid transmission rates, posing a significant challenge to the healthcare authorities to develop suitable therapeutic solution to save lives on earth. The review aims to grab the attention of the researchers all over the globe, towards the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 disease. ACE2 serves as a molecular target for the SARS-CoV-2, to enter the target cell, by interacting with the viral glycoprotein spikes. However, the complexity began when numerous studies identified the protective response of ACE2 in abbreviating the harmful effects of vasoconstrictor, anti-inflammatory peptide, angiotensin 2, by mediating its conversion to angiotensin-(1\u20137), which exercised antagonistic actions to angiotensin 2. Furthermore, certain investigations revealed greater resistance among children as compared to the geriatrics, towards COVID-19 infection, despite the elevated expression of ACE2 in pediatric population. Based upon such evidences, the review demonstrated possible therapeutic interventions, targeting both the protective and deleterious effects of ACE2 in COVID-19 disease, primarily inhibiting ACE2-virus interactions or administering soluble ACE2. Thus, the authors aim to provide an opportunity for the researchers to consider RAAS system to be a significant element in development of suitable treatment regime for COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "A preliminary systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials of cognitive remediation therapy for anorexia nervosa Cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) for anorexia nervosa (AN) was developed as an adjuvant treatment to target set-shifting and central coherence inefficiencies important in AN and to ultimately improve clinical outcomes of those with AN. The primary aim of this preliminary systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the effect of CRT for AN relative to control treatments in randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) on neuropsychological inefficiencies at end-of-treatment. Secondary aims were to assess the effect of CRT for AN on dropout, eating-disorder-related, and other psychological outcomes at end-of-treatment. Systematic review and meta-analytic procedures were conducted in accordance with PRISMA Guidelines. RCTs evaluating CRT for AN compared to a control treatment were identified via ProQuest, PsycINFO, PubMed, and SCOPUS. Seven RCTs and one quasi-RCT of CRT for AN were included. RCT quality ratings ranged from fair (n = 3) to good (n = 4). Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted using Hedge's g. Study heterogeneity was assessed using I2 and publication bias was assessed with Begg's adjusted-rank correlation and the trim-and-fill method. CRT was not associated with improvement in central coherence compared to control treatments at end-of-treatment (g = 0.25, 95% CI = -0.35, 0.85, k = 3). Set-shifting outcomes were mixed due to heterogeneity of set-shifting measures across studies. CRT may prevent dropout; yet, more studies are needed to draw conclusions. CRT did not confer advantage over control treatments for eating-disorder-related and other psychological outcomes at end-of-treatment. Future RCTs of CRT for AN should use precise measures to assess constructs (particularly for set shifting), increase sample size, and implement longitudinal follow-up. (Word Count: 247 words)."

Here, we analyse 196 SARS-Cov-2 genomes collected between Jan 24 and Mar 24 2020, and perform a phylodynamics analysis. In particular, we analyse the doubling time, reproduction number (Rt) and infection duration associated with the epidemic wave that was detected in incidence data starting from Feb 27. We show that a slowing down of the epidemic spread can be detected in Mar, which is consistent with the implementation of the national lock-down on Mar 17. The inferred distributions for the infection duration and Rt are in line with those estimated from contact tracing data. Overall, this analysis shows the potential to use sequence genomic data to inform public health decisions in an epidemic crisis context.",

Here we describe the clinical characteristics, disease outcome and risk factors for ARDS and death of a cohort of 53 kidney transplant patients with COVID\u201019. 8/53 have been handled as outpatients due to mild disease, on average with immunosuppression reduction and the addiction of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin; no patients required admission, developed ARDS or died. 45/53 required admission due to severe symptoms: this cohort has been managed with immunosuppression withdrawal, methylprednisolone 16 mg/day, hydroxychloroquine and antiviral drugs. Dexamethasone and tocilizumab were considered in case of ARDS. 33% of the patients developed AKI, 60% ARDS and 33% died. In this group, thrombocytopenia was associated to ARDS while lymphopenia at the baseline, higher D\u2010dimer and lack of CRP reduction with risk of death. In the overall population, dyspnoea was associated with the risk of ARDS while age older than 60 years and dyspnoea with the risk of death with only a trend towards an increased risk of death for patients on tacrolimus.

      "Meeting the Transitional Care Needs of Older Adults with COVID-19. Older adults with COVID-19 who survive hospitalizations and return to their homes confront substantial health challenges and an unpredictable future. While understanding of the unique needs of COVID-19 survivors is developing, components of the evidence-based Transitional Care Model provide a framework for taking a more immediate, holistic response to caring for these individuals as they moved back into the community. These components include: increasing screening, building trusting relationships, improving patient engagement, promoting collaboration across care teams, undertaking symptom management, increasing family caregiver care/education, coordinating health and social services, and improving care continuity. Evidence generated from rigorous testing of these components reveal the need for federal and state policy solutions to support the following: employment/redeployment of nurses, social workers, and community health workers; training and reimbursement of family caregivers; widespread access to research-based transitional care tools; and coordinated local efforts to address structural barriers to effective transitions. Immediate action on these policy options is necessary to more effectively address the complex issues facing these older adults and their family caregivers who are counting on our care system for essential support.",
      "COVID-19 Blockchain Framework: Innovative Approach The world is currently witnessing dangerous shifts in the epidemic of emerging SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of (COVID-19) coronavirus. The infection, and death numbers reported by World Health Organization (WHO) about this epidemic forecasts an increasing threats to the lives of people and the economics of countries. The greatest challenge that most governments are currently suffering from is the lack of a precise mechanism to detect unknown infected cases and predict the infection risk of COVID-19 virus. In response to mitigate this challenge, this study proposes a novel innovative approach for mitigating big challenges of (COVID-19) coronavirus propagation and contagion. This study propose a blockchain-based framework which investigate the possibility of utilizing peer-to peer, time stamping, and decentralized storage advantages of blockchain to build a new system for verifying and detecting the unknown infected cases of COVID-19 virus. Moreover, the proposed framework will enable the citizens to predict the infection risk of COVID-19 virus within conglomerates of people or within public places through a novel design of P2P-Mobile Application. The proposed approach is forecasted to produce an effective system able to support governments, health authorities, and citizens to take critical decision regarding the infection detection, infection prediction, and infection avoidance. The framework is currently being developed and implemented as a new system consists of four components, Infection Verifier Subsystem, Blockchain platform, P2P-Mobile Application, and Mass-Surveillance System. This four components work together for detecting the unknown infected cases and predicting and estimating the infection Risk of Corona Virus (COVID-19).",
      "In silico multi-epitope vaccine against covid19 showing effective interaction with HLA-B*15:03 The recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV)-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease (covid19) has posed a great threat to human health. Previous outbreaks of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) from the same CoV family had posed similar threat to human health and economic growth. To date, not even a single drug specific to any of these CoVs has been developed nor any anti-viral vaccine is available for the treatment of diseases caused by CoVs. Subunits present in spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are involved in binding to human ACE2 Receptor which is the primary method of viral invasion. As it has been observed in the previous studies that there are very minor differences in the spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 has an additional furin cleavage site that makes it different from SARS-CoV (Walls et al., 2020). In this study, we have analyzed spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV phylogenetically and subjected them to selection pressure analysis. Selection pressure analysis has revealed some important sites in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike glycoproteins that might be involved in their pathogenicity. Further, we have developed a potential multi-epitope vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing its interactions with HLA-B*15:03 subtype. This vaccine consists of multiple T-helper (TH) cells, B-cells, and Cytotoxic T-cells (CTL) epitopes joined by linkers and an adjuvant to increase its immunogenicity. Conservation of selected epitopes in SARS, MERS, and human hosts, suggests that the designed vaccine could provide cross-protection. The vaccine is designed in silico by following a reverse vaccinology method acknowledging its antigenicity, immunogenicity, toxicity, and allergenicity. The vaccine candidate that we have designed as a result of this work shows promising result indicating its potential capability of simulating an immune response.",

      "Highly sensitive and full-genome interrogation of SARS-CoV-2 using multiplexed PCR enrichment followed by next-generation sequencing Many detection methods have been used or reported for the diagnosis and/or surveillance of COVID-19. Among them, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most commonly used because of its high sensitivity, typically claiming detection of about 5 copies of viruses. However, it has been reported that only 47-59% of the positive cases were identified by some RT-PCR methods, probably due to low viral load, timing of sampling, degradation of virus RNA in the sampling process, or possible mutations spanning the primer binding sites. Therefore, alternative and highly sensitive methods are imperative. With the goal of improving sensitivity and accommodating various application settings, we developed a multiplex-PCR-based method comprised of 343 pairs of specific primers, and demonstrated its efficiency to detect SARS-CoV-2 at low copy numbers. The assay produced clean characteristic target peaks of defined sizes, which allowed for direct identification of positives by electrophoresis. We further amplified the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome from 8 to half a million viral copies purified from 13 COVID-19 positive specimens, and detected mutations through next generation sequencing. Finally, we developed a multiplex-PCR-based metagenomic method in parallel, that required modest sequencing depth for uncovering SARS-CoV-2 mutational diversity and potentially novel or emerging isolates.",
      "Analysis of RNA sequences of 3636 SARS-CoV-2 collected from 55 countries reveals selective sweep of one virus type Background & objectives: SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) is evolving with the progression of the pandemic. This study was aimed to investigate the diversity and evolution of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 with progression of the pandemic over time and to identify similarities and differences of viral diversity and evolution across geographical regions (countries). Methods: Publicly available data on type definitions based on whole-genome sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 sampled during December and March 2020 from 3636 infected patients spread over 55 countries were collected. Phylodynamic analyses were performed and the temporal and spatial evolution of the virus was examined. Results: It was found that (i) temporal variation in frequencies of types of the coronavirus was significant; ancestral viruses of type O were replaced by evolved viruses belonging to type A2a; (ii) spatial variation was not significant; with the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the dominant virus was the A2a type virus in every geographical region; (iii) within a geographical region, there was significant micro-level variation in the frequencies of the different viral types, and (iv) the evolved coronavirus of type A2a swept rapidly across all continents. Interpretation & conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 belonging to the A2a type possesses a non-synomymous variant (D614G) that possibly eases the entry of the virus into the lung cells of the host. This may be the reason why the A2a type has an advantage to infect and survive and as a result has rapidly swept all geographical regions. Therefore, large-scale sequencing of coronavirus genomes and, as required, of host genomes should be undertaken in India to identify regional and ethnic variation in viral composition and its interaction with host genomes. Further, careful collection of clinical and immunological data of the host can provide deep learning in relation to infection and transmission of the types of coronavirus genomes."

However, development of veterinary vaccines is a challenging task, in part, due to a variety of pathogens, hosts, and the uniqueness of host-susceptibility to each pathogen. Therefore, novel concepts of vaccines should be explored to overcome the limitation of conventional vaccines. There have been greatly advanced in the completion of genomic sequencing of pathogens, the application of comparative genomic and transcriptome analysis. This would facilitate to open opportunities up to investigate a new generation of vaccines; recombinant subunit vaccine, virus-like particle, DNA vaccine, and vector-vehicle vaccine. Currently, such types of vaccines are being actively explored against various livestock diseases, affording numerous advantages over conventional vaccines, including ease of production, immunogenicity, safety, and multivalency in a single shot. In this articles, the authors present the current status of the development of veterinary vaccines at large as well as research activities conducted in Korea.",

      "In silico multi-epitope vaccine against covid19 showing effective interaction with HLA-B*15:03 The recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV)-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease (covid19) has posed a great threat to human health. Previous outbreaks of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) from the same CoV family had posed similar threat to human health and economic growth. To date, not even a single drug specific to any of these CoVs has been developed nor any anti-viral vaccine is available for the treatment of diseases caused by CoVs. Subunits present in spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are involved in binding to human ACE2 Receptor which is the primary method of viral invasion. As it has been observed in the previous studies that there are very minor differences in the spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 has an additional furin cleavage site that makes it different from SARS-CoV (Walls et al., 2020). In this study, we have analyzed spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV phylogenetically and subjected them to selection pressure analysis. Selection pressure analysis has revealed some important sites in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike glycoproteins that might be involved in their pathogenicity. Further, we have developed a potential multi-epitope vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing its interactions with HLA-B*15:03 subtype. This vaccine consists of multiple T-helper (TH) cells, B-cells, and Cytotoxic T-cells (CTL) epitopes joined by linkers and an adjuvant to increase its immunogenicity. Conservation of selected epitopes in SARS, MERS, and human hosts, suggests that the designed vaccine could provide cross-protection. The vaccine is designed in silico by following a reverse vaccinology method acknowledging its antigenicity, immunogenicity, toxicity, and allergenicity. The vaccine candidate that we have designed as a result of this work shows promising result indicating its potential capability of simulating an immune response.",
      "Design of a Novel Multi Epitope-Based Vaccine for Pandemic Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) by Vaccinomics and Probable Prevention Strategy against Avenging Zoonotics The emergence and rapid expansion of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) require the development of effective countermeasures especially a vaccine to provide active acquired immunity against the virus. This study presented a comprehensive vaccinomics approach applied to the complete protein data published so far in the National Center for Biotechnological Information (NCBI) coronavirus data hub. We identified non-structural protein 8 (Nsp8), 3C-like proteinase, and spike glycoprotein as potential targets for immune responses to COVID-19. Epitopes prediction illustrated both B-cell and T-cell epitopes associated with the mentioned proteins. The shared B and T-cell epitopes: DRDAAMQRK and QARSEDKRA of Nsp8, EDMLNPNYEDL and EFTPFDVVR of 3C-like proteinase, and VNNSYECDIPI of the spike glycoprotein are regions of high potential interest and have a high likelihood of being recognized by the human immune system. The vaccine construct of the epitopes shows stimulation of robust primary immune responses and high level of interferon gamma. Also, the construct has the best conformation with respect to the tested innate immune receptors involving vigorous molecular mechanics and solvation energy. Designing of vaccination strategies that target immune response focusing on these conserved epitopes could generate immunity that not only provide cross protection across Betacoronaviruses but additionally resistant to virus evolution.",
      "The effect of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) on ovarian function and reproductive performance after weaning in Berkshire sows The purpose of this study was to investigate the ovarian condition at weaning and subsequent reproductive performance of Berkshire sows following an outbreak of PED. This study was conducted on a farrow-to-finish farm that experienced a PED outbreak beginning on January 6, 2014. Blood samples were collected at weaning from 19 to 20 sows every month from July 2013 until July 2014 to investigate the ovarian condition. The mean progesterone concentration was numerically higher during January 2014 than the other months, but this difference was not significant. The mean estradiol-17\u03b2 concentration was higher during January 2014 than during July and October 2013 (P < 0.05). In addition, reproductive performance was compared during January, February, and March before (2013) and after (2014) the PED outbreak. Sows that farrowed in January had higher preweaning mortality in 2014 than in 2013 (P < 0.05), but sows that farrowed in February and March had similar preweaning mortality in 2013 and 2014 (P > 0.10). Sows that farrowed between January and March 2014 had 15% lower farrowing rate than those that farrowed during the same months in 2013 (P < 0.05). In conclusion, our results demonstrate poorer reproductive performance of Berkshire sows after a PED outbreak compared with before the outbreak.",
      "Neurosurgery services in Dr. Sardjito General Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia, during COVID-19 pandemic: an experience from a developing country Abstract Background Most articles describing the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on neurosurgical services have been from developed countries. We attempt to report our experience in carrying out neurosurgical services in Dr. Sardjito General Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia, during the time of the pandemic. Methods To collect information on the effect of the pandemic in Indonesia and Yogyakarta, we gathered data from the Indonesian Ministry of Health online database for the national data and local government records for the local data (including records of Dr. Sardjito General Hospital Division of Neurosurgery). Results Compared to other countries, Indonesia has not been severely hit by the impact of COVID-19. To raise the understanding of the natural history of the pandemic, we grouped the period into four different phases: Phase 1 (there was confirmed cases in Indonesia but no cases found in Yogyakarta), Phase 2 (the first case in Yogyakarta detected), Phase 3 (the time when the cumulative cases surpass its peak), and Phase 4 (the pandemic ends). At the time of this writing, we were still in Phase 2 and in this phase, we experienced a decrease in the number of emergency surgical procedures, from an average of 4 to 2.4 procedures per week. Moreover, the number of elective operations dropped from an average of 12 to 9 procedures per week. Conclusions A pandemic, such as COVID-19, reduces both inpatient and outpatient neurosurgical activities. A comprehensive plan can improve both utilization and safety of the neurosurgical staff.",
      "Evidence from two cases of asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2: Are 14 days of isolation sufficient? Among 78 laboratory-confirmed cases, we found two asymptomatic infections. One patient was discharged within 14 days after treatment. Another patient was discharged 25 days after treatment, and his RT-PCR test was still positive on the 15th day. We found that there may be virus carriers in the asymptomatic population with an epidemiological contact history. After 14 days of isolation, those with asymptomatic infection may still carry the virus, which means a risk of transmission, presenting a new challenge for the management of home isolation.",
      "A Review of SARS-CoV-2 and the Ongoing Clinical Trials The sudden outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, later named SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, which rapidly grew into a global pandemic, marked the third introduction of a virulent coronavirus into the human society, affecting not only the healthcare system, but also the global economy. Although our understanding of coronaviruses has undergone a huge leap after two precedents, the effective approaches to treatment and epidemiological control are still lacking. In this article, we present a succinct overview of the epidemiology, clinical features, and molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. We summarize the current epidemiological and clinical data from the initial Wuhan studies, and emphasize several features of SARS-CoV-2, which differentiate it from SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), such as high variability of disease presentation. We systematize the current clinical trials that have been rapidly initiated after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas the trials on SARS-CoV-2 genome-based specific vaccines and therapeutic antibodies are currently being tested, this solution is more long-term, as they require thorough testing of their safety. On the other hand, the repurposing of the existing therapeutic agents previously designed for other virus infections and pathologies happens to be the only practical approach as a rapid response measure to the emergent pandemic, as most of these agents have already been tested for their safety. These agents can be divided into two broad categories, those that can directly target the virus replication cycle, and those based on immunotherapy approaches either aimed to boost innate antiviral immune responses or alleviate damage induced by dysregulated inflammatory responses. The initial clinical studies revealed the promising therapeutic potential of several of such drugs, including favipiravir, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that interferes with the viral replication, and hydroxychloroquine, the repurposed antimalarial drug that interferes with the virus endosomal entry pathway. We speculate that the current pandemic emergency will be a trigger for more systematic drug repurposing design approaches based on big data analysis.",

      "Ethical decision-making for children with neuromuscular disorders in the COVID-19 crisis. The sudden appearance and proliferation of COVID-19 has forced societies and governmental authorities across the world to confront the possibility of resource constraints when critical care facilities are overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of grievously ill patients. As governments and health care systems develop and update policies and guidelines regarding the allocation of resources, patients and families affected by chronic disabilities, including many neuromuscular disorders that affect children and young adults, have become alarmed at the possibility that they may be determined to have less favorable prognoses due to their underlying diagnoses and thus be assigned to lower priority groups. It is important for health care workers, policymakers, and government officials to be aware that the long term prognoses for children and young adults with neuromuscular disorders are often more promising than previously believed, due to a better understanding of the natural history of these diseases, benefits of multidisciplinary supportive care, and novel molecular therapies that can dramatically improve the disease course. Although the realities of a global pandemic have the potential to require a shift from our usual, highly individualistic standards of care to crisis standards of care, shifting priorities should nonetheless be informed by good facts. Resource allocation guidelines with the potential to affect children and young adults with neuromuscular disorders should take into account the known trajectory of acute respiratory illness in this population, and rely primarily on contemporary long-term outcome data.",

      "COVID-19 pandemic and mental health consequences: systematic review of the current evidence BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic general medical complications have received the most attention, whereas only few studies address the potential direct effect on mental health of SARS-CoV-2 and the neurotropic potential. Furthermore, the indirect effects of the pandemic on general mental health are of increasing concern, particularly since the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic (2002-2003) was associated with psychiatric complications. METHODS: We systematically searched the database Pubmed including studies measuring psychiatric symptoms or morbidities associated with COVID-19 among infected patients and among none infected groups the latter divided in psychiatric patients, health care workers and non-health care workers. RESULTS: A total of 43 studies were included. Out of these, only two studies evaluated patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, whereas 41 evaluated the indirect effect of the pandemic (2 on patients with preexisting psychiatric disorders, 20 on medical health care workers, and 19 on the general public). 18 of the studies were case-control studies/compared to norm, while 25 of the studies had no control groups. The two studies investigating COVID-19 patients found a high level of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) (96.2%) and significantly higher level of depressive symptoms (p=0.016). Patients with preexisting psychiatric disorders reported worsening of psychiatric symptoms. Studies investigating health care workers found increased depression/depressive symptoms, anxiety, psychological distress and poor sleep quality. Studies of the general public revealed lower psychological well-being and higher scores of anxiety and depression compared to before COVID-19, while no difference when comparing these symptoms in the initial phase of the outbreak to four weeks later. A variety of factors were associated with higher risk of psychiatric symptoms and/or low psychological well-being including female gender, poor-self-related health and relatives with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Research evaluating the direct neuropsychiatric consequences and the indirect effects on mental health is highly needed to improve treatment, mental health care planning and for preventive measures during potential subsequent pandemics.",
      "Risk factors associated with COVID-19 infection: a retrospective cohort study based on contacts tracing. Objectives To estimate the attack rates, and identify the risk factors of COVID-19 infection. Methods Based on a retrospective cohort study, we investigated 11,580 contacts of COVID-19 cases in Guangdong Province from January 10 to March 15, 2020. All contacts were tested by RT-PCR to detect their infection of SARS-COV-2. Attack rates by characteristics were calculated, and logistic regression was used to estimate the risk factors of infection for COVID-19. Results A total of 515 of 11,580 contacts were identified to be infected with SARS-COV-2. Compared to young adults aged 20-29 years, the infected risk was higher in children (RR: 2.59, 95%CI: 1.79-3.76), and old people aged 60-69 years (RR: 5.29, 95%CI: 3.76-7.46). Females also had higher infected risk (RR: 1.66, 95%CI: 1.39-2.00). People having close relationship with index cases encountered higher risk to be infected (RR for spouse: 20.68, 95%CI: 14.28-29.95; RR for non-spouse family members: 9.55, 95%CI: 6.73-13.55; RR for close relatives: 5.90, 95%CI: 4.06-8.59; RR for other relatives: 3.37, 95%CI: 2.15-5.28). Moreover, contacts exposed to index case in symptomatic period (RR: 2.15, 95%CI: 1.67-2.79), with critically severe symptoms (RR: 1.61, 95%CI: 1.00-2.57), with symptoms of dizzy (RR: 1.58, 95%CI: 1.08-2.30), myalgia (RR: 1.49, 95%CI: 1.15-1.94), and chill (RR: 1.42, 95%CI: 1.05-1.92) had higher infected risks. Conclusion Children, old people, females and family members are susceptible to be infected with COVID-19, while index cases in incubation period had lower contagiousness. Our findings will be helpful for developing targeted prevention and control strategies to combat the worldwide pandemic.",
      "FACTORS INFLUENCING MENTAL HEALTH DURING COVID-19 OUTBREAK: AN EXPLORATORY SURVEY AMONG INDIAN POPULATION Purpose: Research on the impact of social distancing on mental health during epidemics is limited, especially in India. The purpose of this study is to scale the association between anxiety and socio-demographic factors during Covid19 lockdown among the general Indian population. Design/methodology/approach: A descriptive cross-sectional nationwide study was designed to enrol the general population. The inclusion criteria for this study were Indian citizens aged 15 years and above. The study was conducted from 29th March to 12th April 2020, using an online google questionnaire. The anxiety among respondents was detected and measured using a Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale which consists of 7 questions (in English), i.e. GAD-7. Findings: Respondees were 398, and from these participants, the prevalence of anxiety was 25.4 per cent. Based on the bivariate logistic regression analysis, the predictors of anxiety were gender, religion, occupation as business/self- employed, marital status, family size, health status and sleep deprivation. Conclusion: This study reports the prevalence of anxiety among Indian population who were grounded at their homes during lockdown due to coronavirus pandemic in the country. Limitations: (1) The selection of participants through non-random sampling. (2) Because of the cross-sectional character of the study, causal conclusions cannot be drawn. Originality/Value: This paper fulfils an identified need to study the mental health status of the population under situations like lockdown, thereby helping fill a persistent gap in Indian research on this issue.

      "The potential impact of COVID-19 on psychosis: A rapid review of contemporary epidemic and pandemic research The COVID-19 outbreak may profoundly impact population mental health because of exposure to substantial psychosocial stress. An increase in incident cases of psychosis may be predicted. Clinical advice on the management of psychosis during the outbreak needs to be based on the best available evidence. We undertook a rapid review of the impact of epidemic and pandemics on psychosis. Fourteen papers met inclusion criteria. Included studies reported incident cases of psychosis in people infected with a virus of a range of 0.9% to 4%. Psychosis diagnosis was associated with viral exposure, treatments used to manage the infection, and psychosocial stress. Clinical management of these patients, where adherence with infection control procedures is paramount, was challenging. Increased vigilance for psychosis symptoms in patients with COVID-19 is warranted. How to support adherence to physical distancing requirements and engagement with services in patients with existing psychosis requires careful consideration.

      "Modelling insights into the COVID-19 pandemic Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerged infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11th March, 2020. Response to this pandemic has required extensive collaboration across the scientific community in an attempt to contain the virus and limit further transmission. Mathematical modelling has been at the forefront of these response efforts by: (1) providing initial estimates of the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction rate, R(0) (of approximately 2-3); (2) updating these estimates following intervention implementation (with significantly reduced, often sub-critical, transmission rates); (3) assessing the potential for global spread through predictions of the exportation of COVID-19 before significant case numbers had been reported internationally; and (4) quantifying the severity and burden of COVID-19, indicating that the true infection rates are orders of magnitude greater than estimates based on confirmed case counts alone. In this review, we highlight the critical role played by mathematical modelling to understand COVID-19 thus far, the challenges posed by data availability and uncertainty, and the continuing utility of modelling-based approaches to inform the public health response. \u2020Unless otherwise stated, all bracketed error margins correspond to the 95% credible interval (CrI) for reported estimates.",

      "Transmission routes of Covid-19 virus in the Diamond Princess Cruise ship Background: An outbreak of COVID-19 occurred on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in January and February 2020. We analysed information about cases to infer transmission dynamics and potential modes of transmission. Methods: We collected the daily number of 197 symptomatic cases, and that of the 146 passenger cases in two categories, i.e. those who stayed and did not stay in the same stateroom. We retrieved the quarantine details and the ship's 14-day itinerary. We searched the websites of national/local health authority along the cruise routes and local news using Google for locally confirmed cases associated with the ship. We obtained the design of air conditioning and sewage treatment of the ship from literature. We back-calculated the dates of infection from the epidemic curve and compared with the start of on-board quarantine. Results: Major infections started on Jan 28 and completed by Feb 6 for passengers except those who stayed in the same stateroom with infected individual(s). No other confirmed cases were identified among the disembarked people in Hong Kong except an 80 years old passenger. No confirmed cases were reported in three other stopovers between Jan 27-31 associated with disembarked passengers or visitors from the ship, however two Okinawa taxi drivers became confirmed cases in association with driving the ship passengers. Infection among passengers after Feb 6 was limited to those who stayed in the same stateroom with an infected passenger. Infections in crew members peaked on Feb 7, suggesting significant transmission among crew members after quarantine on Feb 5. Conclusions: We infer that the ship central air conditioning system did not play a role, i.e. the long-range airborne route was absent in the outbreak. Most transmission appears to have occurred through close contact and fomites.",
      "Risk factors for wheezing in a subtropical environment Role of respiratory viruses and allergen sensitization Abstract Background Risk factors for acute wheezing among children in subtropical areas are largely unknown. Objective To investigate the role of viral infections, allergen sensitization, and exposure to indoor allergens as risk factors for acute wheezing in children 0 to 12 years old. Methods One hundred thirty-two children 0 to 12 years of age who sought emergency department care for wheezing and 65 children with no history of wheezing were enrolled in this case-control study. Detection of respiratory syncytial virus antigen, rhinovirus and coronavirus RNA, adenovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza antigens was performed in nasal washes. Total IgE and specific IgE to mites, cockroach, cat, and dog were measured with the CAP system. Major allergens from mites, cockroach, cat, and dog were quantified in dust samples by ELISA. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed by logistic regression. Results In children under 2 years of age, infection with respiratory viruses and family history of allergy were independently associated with wheezing (odds ratio, 15.5 and 4.2; P = .0001 and P = .008, respectively). Among children 2 to 12 years old, sensitization to inhalant allergens was the major risk factor for wheezing (odds ratio, 2.7; P = .03). High-level allergen exposure, exposure to tobacco smoke, and lack of breast-feeding showed no association with wheezing. Conclusions Some risk factors for wheezing previously identified in temperate climates were present in a subtropical area, including respiratory syncytial virus infection in infants and allergy in children older than 2 years. Rhinovirus was not associated with wheezing and did not appear to be a trigger for asthma exacerbations.",
      "Pro/con clinical debate: Isolation precautions for all intensive care unit patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization are essential Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are an increasingly common problem in intensive care units (ICUs), and they are capable of impacting on patient outcome, the ICU's budget and bed availability. This issue, coupled with recent outbreaks of illnesses that pose a direct risk to ICU staff (such as SARS [severe acute respiratory syndrome]), has led to renewed emphasis on infection control measures and practitioners in the ICU. Infection control measures frequently cause clinicians to practice in a more time consuming way. As a result it is not surprising that ensuring compliance with these measures is not always easy, particularly when their benefit is not immediately obvious. In this issue of Critical Care, two experts face off over the need to isolate patients infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.",
      "ACE 2 Coding Variants: A Potential X-linked Risk Factor for COVID-19 Disease Viral genetic variants are widely known to influence disease progression among infected humans. Given the recent and rapid emergence of pandemic SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cause of COVID-19 disease, viral protein variants have attracted research interest. However, little has yet been written about genetic risk factors among human hosts. Human genetic variation has proven to affect disease progression and outcome for important diseases such as HIV infection and malaria infestation. The fact that the human ACE2 protein is encoded on the X chromosome means that males who carry rare ACE2 coding variants will express those variants in all ACE2-expressing cells, whereas females will typically express those variants in a mosaic distribution determined by early X-inactivation events. This sex-based difference in ACE2 expression has unique implications for epidemiological studies designed to assess host genetic factors influencing progression from asymptomatic SARS-coV-2 infection to COVID-19. Here we present theoretical modelling of rare ACE2 coding variants documented to occur naturally in several human superpopulations and subpopulations, and show that rare variants predicted to affect the binding of ACE2 to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein exist in people. Though the rs4646116 (p.Lys26Arg) allele is found in 1 in 70 Ashkenazi Jewish males, and in 1 in 172 non-Finnish European males, this allele is found at higher frequencies in females. Furthermore, the class of missense ACE2 alleles predicted to affect SARS-CoV-2 binding are found in aggregate among 1.43% and 2.16% of Ashkenazi males and females, respectively, as well as in 0.58% and 1.24% of European males and females outside of Finland. These alleles are rarer in other population groups, and almost absent from East Asians genotyped to date. Though we are aware that full genome-wide and exome-wide sequencing studies may ultimately be required to assess human genetic susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 fully, we argue on the basis of strong prior probabilities that genotyping of this class of alleles is justified in cases of atypical SARS-CoV-2 diseases, such as asymptomatic super-spreaders (if any are identified), and in neonatal/paediatric-onset COVID-19 disease. Even relatively rare susceptibility factors (1% or fewer carriers) may become quantitatively important in the context of hundreds of thousands of infections. A small number of asymptomatic carriers, or a small number of super-spreaders, or a small segment of the population that is disproportionately likely to require intensive care, can magnify the medical, social and economic impacts of a pandemic of this size. The speed of the pandemic and the large number of affected cases worldwide justify efforts to identify all possible risk factors for adverse outcomes, including efforts to identify genetic susceptibility factors in human hosts.",
      "Descriptive study of COVID-19 outbreak among passengers and crew on Diamond Princess cruise ship, Yokohama Port, Japan, 20 January to 9 February 2020. An outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) occurred on the Diamond Princess cruise ship making an international journey, which led to quarantine of the ship at Yokohama Port, Japan. A suspected COVID-19 case was defined as a passenger or crew member who developed a fever or respiratory symptoms, and a confirmed COVID-19 case had laboratory-confirmation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Between 3 and 9 February 2020, 490 individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 172 were positive (152 passengers (median age: 70 years; interquartile range (IQR): 64-75; males: 45%) and 20 crew (median age: 40 years; IQR: 35-48.5; males: 80%). Other than the Hong Kong-related index case, symptom onset for the earliest confirmed case was 22 January, 2 days after the cruise ship left port. Attack rates among passengers were similar across the decks, while beverage (3.3%, 2/61) and food service staff (5.7%, 14/245) were most affected. Attack rates tended to increase with age. A comprehensive outbreak response was implemented, including surveillance, provision of essential medical care, food and medicine delivery, isolation, infection prevention and control, sampling and disembarkation.",
      "Viral contamination of aerosol and surfaces through toilet use in health care and other settings BACKGROUND: The airborne spreading of enteric viruses can occur through the aerosol and droplets produced by toilet flushing. These can contaminate the surrounding environment, but few data exist to estimate the risk of exposure and infection. For this reason environmental monitoring of air and selected surfaces was carried out in 2 toilets of an office building and in 3 toilets of a hospital before and after cleaning operations. METHODS: To reveal the presence of norovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, human rotavirus, and Torque teno virus and to quantify human adenovirus and bacteria counts, molecular and cultural methods were used. RESULTS: On the whole, viruses were detected on 78% of surfaces and in 81% of aerosol. Among the researched viruses, only human adenovirus and Torque teno virus were found in both surface and air samples. In several cases the same adenovirus strain was concurrently found in all matrices. Bacterial counts were unrelated to viral presence and cleaning did not seem to substantially reduce contamination. CONCLUSIONS: The data collected in our study confirm that toilets are an important source of viral contamination, mainly in health care settings, where disinfection can have a crucial role in preventing virus spread."

      "Fighting COVID-19: a quick review of diagnoses, therapies, and vaccines The COVID-19 pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has infected more than 4.9 million individuals and resulted in over 300,000 deaths globally. The rapid spread of the virus and the precipitously increasing numbers of cases necessitate the urgent development of accurate diagnostic methods, effective treatments, and vaccines. Here, we review the progress of developing diagnostic methods, therapies, and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 with a focus on current clinical trials and their challenges. For diagnosis, nucleic acid amplification tests remain the mainstay diagnostics for laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, while serological antibody tests are used to aid contact tracing, epidemiological, and vaccine evaluation studies. Viral isolation is not recommended for routine diagnostic procedures due to safety concerns. Currently, no single effective drug or specific vaccine is available against SARS-CoV-2. Some candidate drugs targeting different levels and stages of human responses against COVID-19 such as cell membrane fusion, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, viral protease inhibitor, interleukin 6 blocker, and convalescent plasma may improve the clinical outcomes of critical COVID-19 patients. Other supportive care measures for critical patients are still necessary. Advances in genetic sequencing and other technological developments have sped up the establishment of a variety of vaccine platforms. Accordingly, numerous vaccines are under development. Vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 are mainly based upon the viral spike protein due to its vital role in viral infectivity, and most of these candidates have recently moved into clinical trials. Before the efficacy of such vaccines in humans is demonstrated, strong international coordination and collaboration among studies, pharmaceutical companies, regulators, and governments are needed to limit further damage due the emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus.",
      "Willingness, perceived barriers and motivators in adopting mobile applications for health-related interventions among older adults: a scoping review protocol. INTRODUCTION The world's older population continues to grow at an unprecedented rate. An ageing population poses a great challenge to our healthcare system that requires new tool to tackle the complexity of health services as well as the increasing expenses. Mobile health applications (mHealth app) is seen to have the potential to address these challenges, alleviating burdens on the healthcare system and enhance the quality of life for older adults. Despite the numerous benefits of mHealth apps, relatively little is known about whether older adults perceive that these apps confer such benefits. Their perspectives towards the use of mobile applications for health-related purposes have also been little studied. Therefore, in this paper, we outline our scoping review protocol to systematically review literature specific to older adults' willingness, perceived barriers and motivators towards the use of mobile applications to monitor and manage their health. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review methodology framework will guide the conduct of this scoping review. The search strategy will involve electronic databases including PubMed, Excerpta Medica Database, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar and ScienceDirect, in addition to grey literature sources and hand-searching of reference lists. Two reviewers will independently screen all abstracts and full-text studies for inclusion. Data will be charted and sorted through an iterative process by the research team. The extracted data will undergo a descriptive analysis and simple quantitative analysis will be conducted using descriptive statistics. Engagement with relevant stakeholders will be carried out to gain more insights into our data from different perspectives. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Since the data used are from publicly available sources, this study does not require ethical approval. Results will be disseminated through academic journals, conferences and seminars. We anticipate that our findings will aid technology developers and health professionals working in the area of ageing and rehabilitation.",
      "Genetic and biological characterisation of an avian-like H1N2 swine influenza virus generated by reassortment of circulating avian-like H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes in Denmark BACKGROUND: The influenza A virus subtypes H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 are the most prevalent subtypes in swine. In 2003, a reassorted H1N2 swine influenza virus (SIV) subtype appeared and became prevalent in Denmark. In the present study, the reassortant H1N2 subtype was characterised genetically and the infection dynamics compared to an \u201cavian-like\u201d H1N1 virus by an experimental infection study. METHODS: Sequence analyses were performed of the H1N2 virus. Two groups of pigs were inoculated with the reassortant H1N2 virus and an \u201cavian-like\u201d H1N1 virus, respectively, followed by inoculation with the opposite subtype four weeks later. Measurements of HI antibodies and acute phase proteins were performed. Nasal virus excretion and virus load in lungs were determined by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the reassorted H1N2 virus contained a European \u201cavian-like\u201d H1-gene and a European \u201cswine-like\u201d N2-gene, thus being genetically distinct from most H1N2 viruses circulating in Europe, but similar to viruses reported in 2009/2010 in Sweden and Italy. Sequence analyses of the internal genes revealed that the reassortment probably arose between circulating Danish \u201cavian-like\u201d H1N1 and H3N2 SIVs. Infected pigs developed cross-reactive antibodies, and increased levels of acute phase proteins after inoculations. Pigs inoculated with H1N2 exhibited nasal virus excretion for seven days, peaking day 1 after inoculation two days earlier than H1N1 infected pigs and at a six times higher level. The difference, however, was not statistically significant. Pigs euthanized on day 4 after inoculation, had a high virus load in all lung lobes. After the second inoculation, the nasal virus excretion was minimal. There were no clinical sign except elevated body temperature under the experimental conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The \u201cavian-like\u201d H1N2 subtype, which has been established in the Danish pig population at least since 2003, is a reassortant between circulating swine \u201cavian-like\u201d H1N1 and H3N2. The Danish H1N2 has an \u201cavian-like\u201d H1 and differs from most other reported H1N2 viruses in Europe and North America/Asia, which have H1-genes of human or \u201cclassical-swine\u201d origin, respectively. The variant seems, however, also to be circulating in countries like Sweden and Italy. The infection dynamics of the reassorted \u201cavian-like\u201d H1N2 is similar to the older \u201cavian-like\u201d H1N1 subtype.",
      "Cooperation of an RNA packaging signal and a viral envelope protein in coronavirus RNA packaging. Murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) produces a genome-length mRNA, mRNA 1, and six or seven species of subgenomic mRNAs in infected cells. Among these mRNAs, only mRNA 1 is efficiently packaged into MHV particles. MHV N protein binds to all MHV mRNAs, whereas envelope M protein interacts only with mRNA 1. This M protein-mRNA 1 interaction most probably determines the selective packaging of mRNA 1 into MHV particles. A short cis-acting MHV RNA packaging signal is necessary and sufficient for packaging RNA into MHV particles. The present study tested the possibility that the selective M protein-mRNA 1 interaction is due to the packaging signal in mRNA 1. Regardless of the presence or absence of the packaging signal, N protein bound to MHV defective interfering RNAs and intracellularly expressed non-MHV RNA transcripts to form ribonucleoprotein complexes; M protein, however, interacted selectively with RNAs containing the packaging signal. Moreover, only the RNA that interacted selectively with M protein was efficiently packaged into MHV particles. Thus, it was the packaging signal that mediated the selective interaction between M protein and viral RNA to drive the specific packaging of RNA into virus particles. This is the first example for any RNA virus in which a viral envelope protein and a known viral RNA packaging signal have been shown to determine the specificity and selectivity of RNA packaging into virions.",
      "SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccine Development Enabled by Prototype Pathogen Preparedness A SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is needed to control the global COVID-19 public health crisis. Atomic-level structures directed the application of prefusion-stabilizing mutations that improved expression and immunogenicity of betacoronavirus spike proteins. Using this established immunogen design, the release of SARS-CoV-2 sequences triggered immediate rapid manufacturing of an mRNA vaccine expressing the prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer (mRNA-1273). Here, we show that mRNA-1273 induces both potent neutralizing antibody and CD8 T cell responses and protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection in lungs and noses of mice without evidence of immunopathology. mRNA-1273 is currently in a Phase 2 clinical trial with a trajectory towards Phase 3 efficacy evaluation.",
      "Transcriptomic Signatures of Tacaribe Virus-Infected Jamaican Fruit Bats Tacaribe virus (TCRV) is a mammalian arenavirus that was first isolated from artibeus bats in the 1950s. Subsequent experimental infection of Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) caused a disease similar to that of naturally infected bats. Although substantial attention has focused on bats as reservoir hosts of viruses that cause human disease, little is known about the interactions between bats and their pathogens. We performed a transcriptome-wide study to illuminate the response of Jamaican fruit bats experimentally infected with TCRV. Differential gene expression analysis of multiple tissues revealed global and organ-specific responses associated with innate antiviral responses, including interferon alpha/beta and Toll-like receptor signaling, activation of complement cascades, and cytokine signaling, among others. Genes encoding proteins involved in adaptive immune responses, such as gamma interferon signaling and costimulation of T cells by the CD28 family, were also altered in response to TCRV infection. Immunoglobulin gene expression was also elevated in the spleens of infected bats, including IgG, IgA, and IgE isotypes. These results indicate an active innate and adaptive immune response to TCRV infection occurred but did not prevent fatal disease. This de novo assembly provides a high-throughput data set of the Jamaican fruit bat and its host response to TCRV infection, which remains a valuable tool to understand the molecular signatures involved in antiviral responses in bats. IMPORTANCE As reservoir hosts of viruses associated with human disease, little is known about the interactions between bats and viruses. Using Jamaican fruit bats infected with Tacaribe virus (TCRV) as a model, we characterized the gene expression responses to infection in different tissues and identified pathways involved with the response to infection. This report is the most detailed gene discovery work in the species to date and the first to describe immune gene expression responses in bats during a pathogenic viral infection.",
      "Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: treatment and prevention An acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is sustained worsening of dyspnoea and sputum production in patients with COPD. They may be managed in the community with oral steroids and antibiotics but hospital referral is required where there is doubt about the diagnosis or if there are features of severity such as confusion, respiratory distress or haemodynamic instability. Regular review is required as failure to improve should prompt consideration of another diagnosis. In the emergency department, nebulized \u03b2(2)\u2013agonists and anticholinergic bronchodilators should be given and arterial blood gases assessed. Patients with an arterial pH of 7.35 or less should be assessed for non-invasive ventilation. Patients who are stable and are not in type 2 respiratory failure should be considered for discharge if there is adequate home support. Warded patients should be discharged if they are stable for 24 hours and if both patient and doctor are confident that they can manage at home with outpatient follow-up at 4 to 6 weeks. About 25% of COPD patients may not have recovered to baseline lung function at this time.",
      "Ability of device to collect bacteria from cough aerosols generated by adults with cystic fibrosis Background: Identifying lung pathogens and acute spikes in lung counts remain a challenge in the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Bacteria from the deep lung may be sampled from aerosols produced during coughing. Methods: A new device was used to collect and measure bacteria levels from cough aerosols of patients with CF. Sputum and oral specimens were also collected and measured for comparison. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus mitis were detected in specimens using Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) molecular assays. Results: Twenty adult patients with CF and 10 healthy controls participated. CF related bacteria (CFRB) were detected in 13/20 (65%) cough specimens versus 15/15 (100%) sputum specimens. Commensal S. mitis was present in 0/17 (0%, p=0.0002) cough specimens and 13/14 (93%) sputum samples. In normal controls, no bacteria were collected in cough specimens but 4/10 (40%) oral specimens were positive for CFRB. Conclusions: Non-invasive cough aerosol collection may detect lower respiratory pathogens in CF patients, with similar specificity and sensitivity to rates detected by BAL, without contamination by oral CFRB or commensal bacteria.",
      "Towards effective COVID-19 vaccines: Updates, perspectives and challenges (Review) In the current context of the pandemic triggered by SARS-COV-2, the immunization of the population through vaccination is recognized as a public health priority. In the case of SARS-COV-2, the genetic sequencing was done quickly, in one month. Since then, worldwide research has focused on obtaining a vaccine. This has a major economic impact because new technological platforms and advanced genetic engineering procedures are required to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine. The most difficult scientific challenge for this future vaccine obtained in the laboratory is the proof of clinical safety and efficacy. The biggest challenge of manufacturing is the construction and validation of production platforms capable of making the vaccine on a large scale.",

      "Incidence, risk factors, and outcome of pulmonary invasive fungal disease after respiratory virus infection in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence that community\u2010acquired respiratory virus (CARV) increases the risk of pulmonary invasive fungal disease (IFD) in the allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo\u2010HSCT) setting. To date, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the risk factors (RFs), as well as the most critical period for subsequent onset of IFD after CARV infections in allo\u2010HSCT recipients. METHODS: In this prospective longitudinal observational CARV survey, we analyzed the effect of CARV on subsequent IFD development in 287 adult allo\u2010HSCT recipients diagnosed with 597 CARV episodes from December 2013 to December 2018. Multiplex PCR panel assays were used to test CARVs in respiratory specimens. FINDINGS: Twenty\u2010nine out of 287 allo\u2010HSCT recipients (10%) developed IFD after a CARV episode. The median time of IFD onset was 21 days (range, 0\u2010158 days) from day of the first CARV detection. Generalized estimating equation model identified 4 risk factors for IFD: ATG\u2010based conditioning regimen [odds ratio (OR) 2.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05\u20105.2, P = .038], CARV lower respiratory tract disease (OR 10.6, 95% CI 3.7\u201030.8, P < .0001), CARV infection during the first year after transplant (OR 5.34, 95% CI 1.3\u201021.8, P = .014), and corticosteroids during CARV (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.1\u20106.3, P = .03). CONCLUSION: Allo\u2010HSCT recipients conditioned with ATG and under corticosteroid therapy at the time of CARV LRTD during the first year after transplant may require close monitoring for subsequent IFD.",

      "Factors involved in the aerosol transmission of infection and control of ventilation in healthcare premises Summary The epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 highlighted both short- and long-range transmission routes, i.e. between infected patients and healthcare workers, and between distant locations. With other infections such as tuberculosis, measles and chickenpox, the concept of aerosol transmission is so well accepted that isolation of such patients is the norm. With current concerns about a possible approaching influenza pandemic, the control of transmission via infectious air has become more important. Therefore, the aim of this review is to describe the factors involved in: (1) the generation of an infectious aerosol, (2) the transmission of infectious droplets or droplet nuclei from this aerosol, and (3) the potential for inhalation of such droplets or droplet nuclei by a susceptible host. On this basis, recommendations are made to improve the control of aerosol-transmitted infections in hospitals as well as in the design and construction of future isolation facilities.",

We generalise our earlier model of interacting hotspots to test various possibilities of intervention in a model state consisting of multiple epicentres.

      "Design of a Novel Multi Epitope-Based Vaccine for Pandemic Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) by Vaccinomics and Probable Prevention Strategy against Avenging Zoonotics The emergence and rapid expansion of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) require the development of effective countermeasures especially a vaccine to provide active acquired immunity against the virus. This study presented a comprehensive vaccinomics approach applied to the complete protein data published so far in the National Center for Biotechnological Information (NCBI) coronavirus data hub. We identified non-structural protein 8 (Nsp8), 3C-like proteinase, and spike glycoprotein as potential targets for immune responses to COVID-19. Epitopes prediction illustrated both B-cell and T-cell epitopes associated with the mentioned proteins. The shared B and T-cell epitopes: DRDAAMQRK and QARSEDKRA of Nsp8, EDMLNPNYEDL and EFTPFDVVR of 3C-like proteinase, and VNNSYECDIPI of the spike glycoprotein are regions of high potential interest and have a high likelihood of being recognized by the human immune system. The vaccine construct of the epitopes shows stimulation of robust primary immune responses and high level of interferon gamma. Also, the construct has the best conformation with respect to the tested innate immune receptors involving vigorous molecular mechanics and solvation energy. Designing of vaccination strategies that target immune response focusing on these conserved epitopes could generate immunity that not only provide cross protection across Betacoronaviruses but additionally resistant to virus evolution.",
      "Prevention and treatment of COVID-19 disease by controlled modulation of innate immunity The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), triggered by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses an enormous threat to global public health and economies. Human coronaviruses normally cause no or mild respiratory disease but in the past two decades, potentially fatal coronavirus infections have emerged, causing respiratory tract illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchitis. These include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), followed by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and recently the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak that emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Currently, most COVID-19 patients receive traditional supportive care including breathing assistance. To halt the ongoing spread of the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and rescue individual patients, established drugs and new therapies are under evaluation. Since it will be some time until a safe and effective vaccine will be available, the immediate priority is to harness innate immunity to accelerate early antiviral immune responses. Second, since excessive inflammation is a major cause of pathology, targeted anti-inflammatory responses are being evaluated to reduce inflammation-induced damage to the respiratory tract and cytokine storms. Here, we highlight prominent immunotherapies at various stages of development that aim for augmented anti-coronavirus immunity and reduction of pathological inflammation.",
      "Cross-immunity between respiratory coronaviruses may limit COVID-19 fatalities Of the seven coronaviruses associated with disease in humans, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 cause considerable mortality but also share significant sequence homology, and potentially antigenic epitopes capable of inducing an immune response. The degree of similarity is such that perhaps prior exposure to one virus could confer partial immunity to another. Indeed, data suggests a considerable amount of cross-reactivity and recognition by the hosts immune response between different coronavirus infections. While the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak rapidly overwhelmed medical facilities of particularly Europe and North America, accounting for 78% of global deaths, only 8% of deaths have occurred in Asia where the outbreak originated. Interestingly, Asia and the Middle East have previously experienced multiple rounds of coronavirus infections, perhaps suggesting buildup of acquired immunity to the causative SARS-CoV-2 that underlies COVID-19. This article hypothesizes that a causative factor underlying such low morbidity in these regions is perhaps (at least in part) due to acquired immunity from multiple rounds of coronavirus infections and discusses the mechanisms and recent evidence to support such assertions. Further investigations of such phenomenon would allow us to examine strategies to confer protective immunity, perhaps aiding vaccine development.",
      "Coronavirus and PARP expression dysregulate the NAD Metabolome: a potentially actionable component of innate immunity SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus (CoV) and cause of COVID-19, which is much more lethal in older people and those with comorbid conditions for unknown reasons. Innate immune responses to CoVs are initiated by recognition of double-stranded RNA and induction of interferon, which turns on a gene expression program that inhibits viral replication. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells, ferrets and a person strikingly dysregulates the NAD gene set by inducing a set of PARP family members that includes enzymes required for the innate immune response to CoVs. CoV infection also induces a severe attack on host cell NAD. Overexpression of one induced enzyme, PARP10, is sufficient to depress host NAD. Gene expression and pharmacological data suggest that boosting NAD through the nicotinamide and nicotinamide riboside kinase pathways may restore antiviral PARP functions to support innate immunity to CoVs, whereas PARP1,2 inhibition does not restore PARP10 activity.",

We have observed that in the United States of America, there was a nearly exponential spread pattern for a very short period from May 3 to May 8, 2020. From May 9 to May 13, the nearly exponential character of the spread was found to be absent. Hence it can be concluded that the COVID-19 spread pattern, even after more than four months from the start of the outbreak, is not quite predictable. Therefore even short term forecasts regarding the spread may not be very reliable. We have found that forecasts using the assumption of an exponential pattern of spread may actually lead to overestimation.",
      "THE HISTORY OF THE VEGETATION IN SW CONNEMARA (IRELAND) The vegetation history of S.W. Connemara was reconstructed on the basis of the available palynological and palaeobotanical data of the region. In the Pre\u2010Boreal Period birch forests replaced the late\u2010glacial tundra\u2010like vegetation. In the early Boreal Period hazel immigrated and the eutraphent water plant communities reached their optimum. After that thermophilous deciduous forests gradually crowded out the birch woods and reached their optimum in the Atlantic Period. The lakes were increasingly filled with peat, the eutraphent character of the marsh vegetation weakened and ombrogenous bog communities spread across the region. Shortly before the Sub\u2010Boreal Period the first indications of human interference in the forests were detectable. During the Sub\u2010Boreal and Sub\u2010Atlantic Periods the forest area was reduced gradually as a result of human activities and the spreading of the bogs. A more or less complete forest clearance took place in the last thousand years."

      "Laparoscopic anterior hemifundoplication and hiatoplasty for the treatment of upside-down stomach: mid- and long-term results after 40 patients. BACKGROUND Treatment of type 4 hiatal hernia using a minimally invasive approach is challenging and requires good familiarity with this technique. METHODS From October 1992 to August 2010, 40 patients with a median age of 68 years underwent laparoscopic anterior hemifundoplication surgery for upside-down stomach and were included in our prospective study. The median symptoms duration was 5 years. The leading clinical symptoms were postprandial, epigastric, or retrosternal pain (80%), heartburn (78%), regurgitation (80%), dysphagia (53%), and anemia (48%). Preoperative evaluation included blood test, chest X-ray, upper endoscopy, and barium swallow. In some patients an esophageal 24-h pH study and esophageal manometry were performed. The median follow-up was 46 months using a standardized questionnaire, including Smiley score, modified Visick score, gastrointestinal quality-of-life index (GQLI), and specific reflux symptoms score. RESULTS Surgery was finished laparoscopically in 39 patients (97%). One patient had to be converted to an open procedure because of severe adhesions. Mesh hiatoplasty had to be performed in one patient due to a large hiatal defect. Median operative time was 160 min (range=90-275) and median blood loss was 5 ml (range=0-300). Seven patients (18%) presented with acute symptoms. Intraoperative technical complications occurred in four patients (10%) and nontechnical complications in two cases (5%). Median postoperative hospital stay was 5 days (range=2-17). Postoperative complications occurred in two patients (5%): one pleural effusion and one surgical emphysema. There was no mortality or symptomatic recurrence. All scores showed significant improvement and patient satisfaction. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic treatment of type 4 hiatal hernia is safe. With respect to the quality of life, anterior hemifundoplication is highly effective.",
      "Incidence, etiology, and symptomatology of upper respiratory illness in elite athletes. PURPOSE Upper respiratory illness (URI) is the most common medical condition affecting elite athletes. The aims of this study were to identify and evaluate the incidence, pathogenic etiology, and symptomatology of acute URI during a 5-month training and competition period. METHODS Thirty-two elite and 31 recreationally competitive triathletes and cyclists, and 20 sedentary controls (age range 18.0-34.1 yr) participated in a prospective surveillance study. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs were collected from subjects presenting with two or more defined upper respiratory symptoms. Swabs were analyzed using microscopy, culture, and PCR testing for typical and atypical respiratory pathogens. The Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-44) was used to assess symptomatology and functional impairment. RESULTS Thirty-seven URI episodes were reported in 28 subjects. Incidence rate ratios for illness were higher in both the control subjects (1.93, 95% CI: 0.72-5.18) and elite athletes (4.50, 1.91-10.59) than in the recreationally competitive athletes. Infectious agents were identified in only 11 (two control, three recreationally competitive, and six elite) out of 37 illness episodes. Rhinovirus was the most common respiratory pathogen isolated. Symptom and functional impairment severity scores were higher in subjects with an infectious pathogen episode, particularly on illness days 3-4. CONCLUSION The results confirm a higher rate of URI among elite athletes than recreationally competitive athletes during this training and competition season. However, because pathogens were isolated in fewer than 30% of URI cases, further study is required to uncover the causes of unidentified but symptomatic URI in athletes. Despite the common perception that all URI are infections, physicians should consider both infectious and noninfectious causes when athletes present with symptoms.",

      "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Spread and Pharmacovigilance Implications: Expert Opinion The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading throughout the world after emerging in China in December 2019. Currently, there are no approved treatments for COVID-19 based on large clinical trial data, and hence, management involves infection prevention and control measures and supportive care. With anecdotal reports and in vitro studies suggesting that certain medicines already in use for treatment of other conditions could be viable treatment options, there has been an increased demand for these therapies which could have adverse consequences on patients and healthcare systems. Toxicity from these medicines resulting from a mad rush for them at community pharmacies and pressure on physicians to prescribe for individuals who do not have the infection are worth noting. Furthermore, the indiscriminate use of these medicines could result in viral resistance as well as acute shortage such that patients who routinely take them for other conditions may not get them.",

Since no specific therapy is available thus far, there is an urgent need for the discovery of agents capable of inhibiting its viral replication and deleterious effects. Chloroquine is widely used as an antimalarial drug, anti-inflammatory agent, and it also shows antiviral activity against several viruses. Here we show that chloroquine exhibits antiviral activity against ZIKV in Vero cells, human brain microvascular endothelial cells, human neural stem cells, and mouse neurospheres. We demonstrate that chloroquine reduces the number of ZIKV-infected cells in vitro, and inhibits virus production and cell death promoted by ZIKV infection without cytotoxic effects. In addition, chloroquine treatment partially reveres morphological changes induced by ZIKV infection in mouse neurospheres.",

      "Frontline Workers in the Backrooms of COVID-19 OBJECTIVES: To review the response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in a forensics center that integrates an academic department of pathology with multiple regional county medical examiners' offices. METHODS: Faculty and staff were asked to volunteer stories, data, and photographs describing their activities from March through May 2020. The information was assembled into a narrative summary. RESULTS: Increased deaths challenged capacity limits in a hospital morgue and a large urban medical examiner's office (MEO) successfully managed by forensic teams and monitored by an institutional command center. Autopsies of suspected and proven cases of COVID-19 were performed in both facilities. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing of decedents was performed in a MEO serving a large urban area. Scene investigators worked directly with families to meet needs unique to a pandemic. Artful photographs of decedent's hands and/or tattoos were offered to those unable to have in-person viewings. Pathologists and social workers were available to families of the deceased and created novel solutions to facilitate the grieving process. CONCLUSIONS: Forensic pathology is important to successfully navigating emerging diseases like the COVID-19 pandemic. Direct conversations with families are common in forensic pathology and serve as a model for patient- and family-centered care."

      "Glycyrrhizin inhibits the manifestations of anti-inflammatory responses that appear in association with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)-like reactions Abstract In association with the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), anti-inflammatory response syndrome is commonly manifested in patients with trauma, burn injury, and after major surgery. These patients are increasingly susceptible to infection with various pathogens due to the excessive release of anti-inflammatory cytokines from anti-inflammatory effector cells. Recently, CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) found in the sera of mice with pancreatitis was identified as an active molecule for SIRS-associated anti-inflammatory response manifestation. Also, the inhibitory activity of glycyrrhizin (GL) on CCL2 production was reported. Therefore, the effect of GL on SIRS-associated anti-inflammatory response manifestation was investigated in a murine SIRS model. Without any stimulation, splenic T cells from mice 5 days after SIRS induction produced cytokines associated with anti-inflammatory response manifestation. However, these cytokines were not produced by splenic T cells from SIRS mice previously treated with GL. In dual-chamber transwells, IL-4-producing cells were generated from normal T cells cultured with peripheral blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) from SIRS mice. However, IL-4-producing cells were not generated from normal T cells in transwell cultures performed with PMN from GL-treated SIRS mice. CCL2 was produced by PMN from SIRS mice, while this chemokine was not demonstrated in cultures of PMN from SIRS mice treated with GL. These results indicate that GL has the capacity to suppress SIRS-associated anti-inflammatory response manifestation through the inhibition of CCL2 production by PMN.",
      "Managing patients with rheumatic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic: The French Society of Rheumatology answers to most frequently asked questions up to May 2020 BACKGROUND: Rheumatologists must contend with COVID-19 pandemic in the management of their patients and many questions have been raised on the use of both anti-inflammatory drugs and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD). The French Society of Rheumatology (SFR) selected the most critical ones to the daily practice of a rheumatologist and a group of 10 experts from SFR and Club Rheumatism and Inflammation (CRI) boards proposed responses based on the current knowledge of May 2020. METHODS: Following the availability of the first 18 questions and statements, 1400 individuals consulted the frequently asked questions between the March 31, 2020 and April 12, 2020. As a result, 16 additional questions were forwarded to the SFR, and answered by the board. An additional round of review by email and video conference was organized, which included updates of the previous statements. The scientific relevance of 5 of the questions led to their inclusion in this document. Each response received a final assessment on a scale of 0-10 with 0 meaning no agreement whatsoever and 10 being in complete agreement. The mean values of these votes for each question are presented as the levels of agreement (LoA) at the end of each response. This document was last updated on April 17, 2020. RESULTS: Based on current scientific literature already published, in most circumstances, there is no contraindication to the initiation or continuation of anti-inflammatory drugs as well as DMARDs. If signs suggestive of infection (coronavirus or other) occur, treatments should be discontinued and resumed, if necessary, after 2 weeks without any symptoms. Only, some signals suggest that people taking an immunosuppressive dose of corticosteroid therapy are at greater risk of developing severe COVID-19. Intra-articular injections of glucocorticoids are allowed when there is no reasonable therapeutic alternative, and providing that precautions to protect the patient and the practitioner from viral contamination are adopted, included appropriate information to the patient. CONCLUSIONS: Currently available data on managing patients with rheumatic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic are reassuring and support continuing or initiating symptomatic as well as specific treatments of these diseases, the main target of their management remaining their appropriate control, even during this pandemic.",
      "Prevention and treatment of COVID-19 disease by controlled modulation of innate immunity The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), triggered by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses an enormous threat to global public health and economies. Human coronaviruses normally cause no or mild respiratory disease but in the past two decades, potentially fatal coronavirus infections have emerged, causing respiratory tract illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchitis. These include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), followed by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and recently the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak that emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Currently, most COVID-19 patients receive traditional supportive care including breathing assistance. To halt the ongoing spread of the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and rescue individual patients, established drugs and new therapies are under evaluation. Since it will be some time until a safe and effective vaccine will be available, the immediate priority is to harness innate immunity to accelerate early antiviral immune responses. Second, since excessive inflammation is a major cause of pathology, targeted anti-inflammatory responses are being evaluated to reduce inflammation-induced damage to the respiratory tract and cytokine storms. Here, we highlight prominent immunotherapies at various stages of development that aim for augmented anti-coronavirus immunity and reduction of pathological inflammation.",

      "The role of viral persistence in flavivirus biology In nature, vector-borne flaviviruses are persistently cycled between either the tick or mosquito vector and small mammals such as rodents, skunks, and swine. These viruses account for considerable human morbidity and mortality worldwide. Increasing and substantial evidence of viral persistence in humans, which includes the isolation of RNA by RT-PCR and infectious virus by culture, continues to be reported. Viral persistence can also be established in vitro in various human, animal, arachnid and insect cell lines in culture. Although some research has focused on the potential roles of defective virus particles, evasion of the immune response through the manipulation of autophagy and/or apoptosis, the precise mechanism of flavivirus persistence is still not well understood. We propose additional research for further understanding of how viral persistence is established in different systems. Avenues for additional studies include determining if the multifunctional flavivirus protein NS5 has a role in viral persistence, the development of relevant animal models of viral persistence as well as investigating the host responses that allow vector borne flavivirus replication without detrimental effects on infected cells. Such studies might shed more light on the viral-host relationships, and could be used to unravel the mechanisms for establishment of persistence.",
      "Coagulopathy of Coronavirus Disease 2019 OBJECTIVES: Recent studies have reported a high prevalence of thrombotic events in coronavirus disease 2019. However, the significance of thromboembolic complications has not been widely appreciated. The purpose of this review is to provide current knowledge of this serious problem. DESIGN: Narrative review. DATA SOURCES: Online search of published medical literature through PubMed using the term \"COVID-19,\" \"SARS,\" \"acute respiratory distress syndrome,\" \"coronavirus,\" \"coagulopathy,\" \"thrombus,\" and \"anticoagulants.\" STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles were chosen for inclusion based on their relevance to coagulopathy and thrombosis in coronavirus disease 2019, and anticoagulant therapy. Reference lists were reviewed to identify additional relevant articles. DATA SYNTHESIS: Coronavirus disease 2019 is associated with a strikingly high prevalence of coagulopathy and venous thromboembolism that may contribute to respiratory deterioration. Monitoring coagulation variables is important, as abnormal coagulation tests are related to adverse outcomes and may necessitate adjuvant antithrombotic interventions. In the initial phase of the infection, D-dimer and fibrinogen levels are increased, while activated partial prothrombin time, prothrombin time, and platelet counts are often relatively normal. Increased D-dimer levels three times the upper limit of normal may trigger screening for venous thromboembolism. In all hospitalized patients, thromboprophylaxis using low-molecular-weight heparin is currently recommended. The etiology of the procoagulant responses is complex and thought to be a result of specific interactions between host defense mechanisms and the coagulation system. Although the coagulopathy is reminiscent of disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombotic microangiopathy, it has features that are markedly distinct from these entities. CONCLUSIONS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2/coronavirus disease 2019 frequently induces hypercoagulability with both microangiopathy and local thrombus formation, and a systemic coagulation defect that leads to large vessel thrombosis and major thromboembolic complications, including pulmonary embolism in critically ill hospitalized patients. D-dimers and fibrinogen levels should be monitored, and all hospitalized patients should undergo thromboembolism prophylaxis with an increase in therapeutic anticoagulation in certain clinical situations.",
      "The molecular basis of paediatric malarial disease Severe falciparum malaria is an acute systemic disease that can affect multiple organs, including those in which few parasites are found. The acute disease bears many similarities both clinically and, potentially, mechanistically, to the systemic diseases caused by bacteria, rickettsia, and viruses. Traditionally the morbidity and mortality associated with severe malarial disease has been explained in terms of mechanical obstruction to vascular flow by adherence to endothelium (termed sequestration) of erythrocytes containing mature-stage parasites. However, over the past few decades an alternative \u2018cytokine theory of disease\u2019 has also evolved, where malarial pathology is explained in terms of a balance between the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The final common pathway for this pro-inflammatory imbalance is believed to be a limitation in the supply and mitochondrial utilisation of energy to cells. Different patterns of ensuing energy depletion (both temporal and spatial) throughout the cells in the body present as different clinical syndromes. This chapter draws attention to the over-arching position that inflammatory cytokines are beginning to occupy in the pathogenesis of acute malaria and other acute infections. The influence of inflammatory cytokines on cellular function offers a molecular framework to explain the multiple clinical syndromes that are observed during acute malarial illness, and provides a fresh avenue of investigation for adjunct therapies to ameliorate the malarial disease process."

      "Preventing major outbreaks of COVID-19 in jails",
      "Direct diagnostic testing of SARS-CoV-2 without the need for prior RNA extraction. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an urgent global need for rapid, point-of-care diagnostic testing. Existing methods for nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) require an RNA extraction step prior to amplification of the viral RNA. This step necessitates the use of a centralized laboratory or complex and costly proprietary cartridges and equipment, and thereby prevents low-cost, scalable, point-of-care testing. We report the development of a highly sensitive and robust, easy-to-implement, SARS-CoV-2 test that utilizes isothermal amplification and can be run directly on viral transport media following a nasopharyngeal swab without the need for prior RNA extraction. Our assay provides visual results in 30 min with 85% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and a limit of detection (LoD) of 2.5 copies/l, and can be run using a simple heat block.",
      "The SARS, MERS and novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemics, the newest and biggest global health threats: what lessons have we learned? OBJECTIVES: To provide an overview of the three major deadly coronaviruses and identify areas for improvement of future preparedness plans, as well as provide a critical assessment of the risk factors and actionable items for stopping their spread, utilizing lessons learned from the first two deadly coronavirus outbreaks, as well as initial reports from the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic in Wuhan, China. METHODS: Utilizing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA) website, and a comprehensive review of PubMed literature, we obtained information regarding clinical signs and symptoms, treatment and diagnosis, transmission methods, protection methods and risk factors for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19. Comparisons between the viruses were made. RESULTS: Inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation, and limited reporting on the virus within China has, in part, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout mainland China and into proximal and distant countries. Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due in part to increased globalization and the focus of the epidemic. Wuhan, China is a large hub connecting the North, South, East and West of China via railways and a major international airport. The availability of connecting flights, the timing of the outbreak during the Chinese (Lunar) New Year, and the massive rail transit hub located in Wuhan has enabled the virus to perforate throughout China, and eventually, globally. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that we did not learn from the two prior epidemics of coronavirus and were ill-prepared to deal with the challenges the COVID-19 epidemic has posed. Future research should attempt to address the uses and implications of internet of things (IoT) technologies for mapping the spread of infection.",
      "Testing times in Coronavirus disease (Covid-19): A tale of two nations The Coronavirus Disease (Covid-19) pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 and was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease spread globally, leading to the World Health Organization declaring it a pandemic in March 2020. The condition is often fatal in its severe form. As it is a previously unknown virus, no treatment is identified or any vaccine available. The burden of disease control and containment, therefore, falls upon a robust and geographically appropriate testing strategy. Testing policies are modified, in turn, by the rapidly evolving patterns of the disease in various nations and by the evolving nature of tests in development. It is, therefore, helpful to study different national models to learn from the experience of different countries. This article compares testing strategies in the UK and India as the two countries travel different paths in controlling the pandemic. The UK is one of the most severely affected countries in the world. Initially restricted to hospitalised patients, the UK has broadened the scope of testing to many categories of individuals. In contrast, India appears to have a lower prevalence of the infection. However, the large Indian population and relatively insufficient testing capacities so far have led India to adopt a different testing trajectory, with the testing currently focused on high-risk groups in the community and hospitals. Owing to the rapidly changing nature of the disease, there can be no \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 policy but should be based on country-specific circumstances.",
      "Understanding, verifying and implementing Emergency Use Authorization molecular diagnostics for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has brought a new wave of challenges to health care, particularly in the area of rapid diagnostic test development and implementation. Acute diagnosis of COVID-19 infection is critically dependent on detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from clinical specimens (e.g. nasopharyngeal swabs). While laboratory-developed testing for SARS-CoV-2 is an essential component of diagnostic testing for this virus, the majority of clinical microbiology laboratories are dependent on commercially available SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays. In contrast to assays approved or cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for in vitro diagnostic use, assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids have Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA. Outside of highly specialized academic and commercial laboratory settings, clinical microbiology laboratories are likely unfamiliar with EUA classification and thus assay verification can be daunting. Further compounding anxiety for laboratories are major issues with supply chain that are dramatically affecting the availability of test reagents and requiring laboratories to implement multiple commercial EUA tests.

The virus was detected with high sensitivity and specificity by a slide agglutination test using latex particles coated with antibody against the porcine rotavirus strain OSU (LA-antiOSU). The agglutination of LA-antiOSU with OSU on a glass slide evident macroscopically within 2 min. The sensitivity of this latex agglutination (LA) test was four times higher than that of the electron microscope method. The LA test is available for the rapid diagnosis of porcine rotavirus infections.",
      "A Novel Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Method for Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 has become a major global public health burden, currently causing a rapidly growing number of infections and significant morbidity and mortality around the world. Early detection with fast and sensitive assays and timely intervention are crucial for interrupting the spread of the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2). Using a mismatch-tolerant amplification technique, we developed a simple, rapid, sensitive and visual reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection based on its N gene. The assay has a high specificity and sensitivity, and robust reproducibility, and its results can be monitored using a real-time PCR machine or visualized via colorimetric change from red to yellow. The limit of detection (LOD) of the assay is 118.6 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA per 25 \u03bcL reaction. The reaction can be completed within 30 min for real-time fluorescence monitoring, or 40 min for visual detection when the template input is more than 200 copies per 25 \u03bcL reaction. To evaluate the viability of the assay, a comparison between the RT-LAMP and a commercial RT-qPCR assay was made using 56 clinical samples. The SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP assay showed perfect agreement in detection with the RT-qPCR assay. The newly-developed SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP assay is a simple and rapid method for COVID-19 surveillance.",
      "Debate: COVID-19 and children in India The COVID-19 pandemic impact on children is a growing concern. The United Nations and its agencies (the World Health Organization and UNICEF), Indian Association For Child and Adolescent Mental Health and National Institute of Mental Health and Neuroscience in India warn about the broader impacts on children and call for urgent action to support the world's children amidst the pandemic which may have lasting consequences. The COVID-19 pandemic and unprecedented control measures to prevent its spread have disrupted nearly every aspect of children's lives - their health, development, learning, behaviour and their families' economic security, including protection from violence and abuse. Given this background, there is an urgent need for action through screening to minimize the mental health issues of children in India who constitute a substantial proportion of the population.",

      "Obesity and COVID-19: immune and metabolic derangement as a possible link to adverse clinical outcomes Recent reports have shown a strong association between obesity and the severity of COVID-19 infection, even in the absence of other comorbidities. After infecting the host cells, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may cause a hyperinflammatory reaction through the excessive release of cytokines, a condition known as \u201ccytokine storm,\u201d while inducing lymphopenia and a disrupted immune response. Obesity is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation and immune dysregulation, but the exact mechanisms through which it exacerbates COVID-19 infection are not fully clarified. The production of increased amounts of cytokines such as TNF\u03b1, IL-1, IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) lead to oxidative stress and defective function of innate and adaptive immunity, whereas the activation of NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome seems to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the infection. Endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness could favor the recently discovered infection of the endothelium by SARS-CoV-2, whereas alterations in cardiac structure and function and the prothrombotic microenvironment in obesity could provide a link for the increased cardiovascular events in these patients. The successful use of anti-inflammatory agents such as IL-1 and IL-6 blockers in similar hyperinflammatory settings, like that of rheumatoid arthritis, has triggered the discussion of whether such agents could be administrated in selected patients with COVID-19 disease.",

      "Transcriptomic characteristics of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and peripheral blood mononuclear cells in COVID-19 patients Circulating in China and 158 other countries and areas, the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has caused devastating mortality and posed a great threat to public health. However, efforts to identify effectively supportive therapeutic drugs and treatments has been hampered by our limited understanding of host immune response for this fatal disease. To characterize the transcriptional signatures of host inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 (HCoV-19) infection, we carried out transcriptome sequencing of the RNAs isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) specimens of COVID-19 patients. Our results reveal distinct host inflammatory cytokine profiles to SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients, and highlight the association between COVID-19 pathogenesis and excessive cytokine release such as CCL2/MCP-1, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL3/MIP-1A, and CCL4/MIP1B. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 induced activation of apoptosis and P53 signalling pathway in lymphocytes may be the cause of patients\u2019 lymphopenia. The transcriptome dataset of COVID-19 patients would be a valuable resource for clinical guidance on anti-inflammatory medication and understanding the molecular mechansims of host response.",
      "COVIDiagnosis-Net: Deep Bayes-SqueezeNet based Diagnostic of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) from X-Ray Images The COVID-19 outbreak has a tremendous impact on global health and the daily life of people still living in more than two hundred countries. The crucial action to gain the force in the fight of COVID-19 is to have powerful monitoring of the site forming infected patients. Most of the initial tests rely on detecting the genetic material of the coronavirus, and they have a poor detection rate with the time-consuming operation. In the ongoing process, radiological imaging is also preferred where chest X-rays are highlighted in the diagnosis. Early studies express the patients with an abnormality in chest X-rays pointing to the presence of the COVID-19. On this motivation, there are several studies cover the deep learning-based solutions to detect the COVID-19 using chest X-rays. A part of the existing studies use non-public datasets, others perform on complicated Artificial Intelligent (AI) structures. In our study, we demonstrate an AI-based structure to outperform the existing studies. The SqueezeNet that comes forward with its light network design is tuned for the COVID-19 diagnosis with Bayesian optimization additive. Fine-tuned hyperparameters and augmented dataset make the proposed network perform much better than existing network designs and to obtain a higher COVID-19 diagnosis accuracy.",
      "A Machine Learning Model Reveals Older Age and Delayed Hospitalization as Predictors of Mortality in Patients with COVID-19 Objective: The recent pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is increasingly causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and significant mortality. We aim here to identify the risk factors associated with mortality of coronavirus infected persons using a supervised machine learning approach. Research Design and Methods: Clinical data of 1085 cases of COVID-19 from 13th January to 28th February, 2020 was obtained from Kaggle, an online community of Data scientists. 430 cases were selected for the final analysis. Random Forest classification algorithm was implemented on the dataset to identify the important predictors and their effects on mortality. Results: The Area under the ROC curve obtained during model validation on the test dataset was 0.97. Age was the most important variable in predicting mortality followed by the time gap between symptom onset and hospitalization. Conclusions: Patients aged beyond 62 years are at higher risk of fatality whereas hospitalization within 2 days of the onset of symptoms could reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients."

      "Depression and anxiety during 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic in Saudi Arabia: a cross-sectional study Background: COVID 19 outbreak in 2020 was associated with a high rate of depression and anxiety among individuals in the affected countries. The aim of this study is to explore the influence of the COVID 19 epidemic on the psychological distress of residents of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Methods: A cross sectional study using an online survey was conducted in Saudi Arabia between 27th of March and 27th of April 2020. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ 9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD 7) were used to assess depression and anxiety. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of depression and anxiety. Results: The prevalence of depression and anxiety among the entire study participants was 9.4% and 7.3%, respectively. Non-Saudi residents, aged 50 years and above, divorced, retired, university students, and those with income (2000 to 10,000 RS) were at higher risk of developing depression. Saudi individuals, married, unemployed, and those with high income (> 10,000 RS) were at higher risk of developing anxiety. Conclusions: There is a wide range of the Saudi residents who are at higher risk of mental illness during COVID 19 pandemic. Policymakers and mental healthcare providers are advised to provide continuous monitoring of the psychological consequences during this pandemic, and provide mental support.",

      "Validation of a commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serological Immunoassay Aims: To validate the diagnostic accuracy of a Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA immunoassay for COVID-19 disease. Methods: In this unmatched (1:1) case-control validation study, we used sera of 181 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and 176 negative controls collected before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Diagnostic accuracy of the immunoassay was assessed against a whole spike protein-based recombinant immunofluorescence assay (rIFA) by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. Discrepant cases between ELISA and rIFA were further tested by pseudo-neutralization assay. Results: COVID-19 patients were more likely to be male and older than controls, and 50.3% of them were hospitalized. ROC curve analyses indicated that IgG and IgA had a high diagnostic accuracy with AUCs of 0.992 (95% Confidence Interval [95%CI]: 0.986-0.996) and 0.977 (95%CI: 0.963-0.990), respectively. IgG assays outperformed IgA assays (p=0.008). Considering optimized cut-offs taking the 15% inter-assay imprecision assessed into account, an IgG ratio cut-off > 1.5 displayed a 100% specificity (95%CI: 98-100) and a 100% positive predictive value (95%CI: 97-100). A 0.5 cut-off displayed a 97% sensitivity (95%CI: 93-99) and a 97% negative predictive value (95%CI: 93-99). Adopting these thresholds, rather than those of the manufacturer, improved assay performance, leaving 12% of IgG ratios ranging between 0.5-1.5 as indeterminate. Conclusions: The Euroimmun assay displays a nearly optimal diagnostic accuracy using IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in a samples of patients, without any obvious gains from considering IgA serology. The optimized cut-offs are fit for rule-in and rule-out purposes, allowing determination of whether individuals have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or not in our study population. They should however not be considered as a surrogate of protection at this stage.",
      "dK-Microaggregation: Anonymizing Graphs with Differential Privacy Guarantees With the advances of graph analytics, preserving privacy in publishing graph data becomes an important task. However, graph data is highly sensitive to structural changes. Perturbing graph data for achieving differential privacy inevitably leads to inject a large amount of noise and the utility of anonymized graphs is severely limited. In this paper, we propose a microaggregation-based framework for graph anonymization which meets the following requirements: (1) The topological structures of an original graph can be preserved at different levels of granularity; (2) [Formula: see text]-differential privacy is guaranteed for an original graph through adding controlled perturbation to its edges (i.e., edge privacy); (3) The utility of graph data is enhanced by reducing the magnitude of noise needed to achieve [Formula: see text]-differential privacy. Within the proposed framework, we further develop a simple yet effective microaggregation algorithm under a distance constraint. We have empirically verified the noise reduction and privacy guarantee of our proposed algorithm on three real-world graph datasets. The experiments show that our proposed framework can significantly reduce noise added to achieve [Formula: see text]-differential privacy over graph data, and thus enhance the utility of anonymized graphs.",
      "The use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay systems for serology and antigen detection in parvovirus, coronavirus and rotavirus infections in dogs in The Netherlands Abstract Complex trapping blocking (CTB) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and indirect ELISAs for the detection of antibodies to canine parvovirus (CPV), canine coronavirus (CCV) and rotavirus in sera of dogs were established. Double antibody sandwich ELISAs for the detection of CPV-, CCV- and rotavirus antigens in fecal samples were also developed. Both the serological and antigen-detection ELISAs were used to screen samples from dogs in The Netherlands, with or without a history of acute diarrhea. It was shown that the results of the respective serological ELISAs correlated well and that CPV was the major cause of virus-induced acute diarrhea in dogs in The Netherlands.",
      "SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody detection for sero-epidemiology: a multiplex analysis approach accounting for accurate seroprevalence Background The COVID-19 pandemic demands detailed understanding of the kinetics of antibody production induced by infection with SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to develop a high throughput multiplex assay to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to assess immunity to the virus in the general population. Methods Spike protein subunits S1 and RBD, and Nucleoprotein were coupled to distinct microspheres. Sera collected before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (N=224), and of non-SARS-CoV-2 influenza-like illness (N=184), and laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (N=115) with various severity of COVID-19 were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific concentrations of IgG. Results Our assay discriminated SARS-CoV-2-induced antibodies and those induced by other viruses. The assay obtained a specificity between 95.1 and 99.0% with a sensitivity ranging from 83.6-95.7%. By merging the test results for all 3 antigens a specificity of 100% was achieved with a sensitivity of at least 90%. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients developed higher IgG concentrations and the rate of IgG production increased faster compared to non-hospitalized cases. Conclusions The bead-based serological assay for quantitation of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies proved to be robust and can be conducted in many laboratories. Finally, we demonstrated that testing of antibodies against different antigens increases sensitivity and specificity compared to single antigen-specific IgG determination.",
      "Postoperative pulmonary complications and thoracocentesis associated with early versus late chest tube removal after thoracic esophagectomy with three-field dissection: a propensity score matching analysis. PURPOSE To evaluate the safety of early chest tube removal after thoracic esophagectomy with three-field dissection. METHODS This prospective cohort study evaluated patients who underwent thoracic esophagectomy with three-field dissection during 2013-2015. Patients were divided into two groups according to whether they underwent early or late chest tube removal. Propensity score matching in a 1:1 ratio was applied. We compared the incidences of postoperative pulmonary complications and thoracocentesis in the two groups. RESULTS After propensity score matching, 89 patients in each group were analyzed. There was no significant difference between the groups in the incidences of pulmonary complications or thoracocentesis. Significantly more patients achieved first mobilization within 15 h postoperatively in the early removal group (89.8%) than in the late removal group (52%, p < 0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed that early chest tube removal was not a risk factor for pulmonary complications or thoracocentesis. Independent risk factors for pulmonary complications were a history of pulmonary disease (odds ratio: 0.81 [0.63-0.98]; p = 0.02) and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (odds ratio: 0.67 [0.32-0.96]; p = 0.04). CONCLUSION Early chest tube removal is as safe and feasible as late chest tube removal after thoracic esophagectomy with three-field dissection.",
      "Serodiagnostics for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus-2: A Narrative Review Accurate serologic tests to detect host antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) will be critical for the public health response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Many use cases are envisaged, including complementing molecular methods for diagnosis of active disease and estimating immunity for individuals. At the population level, carefully designed seroepidemiologic studies will aid in the characterization of transmission dynamics and refinement of disease burden estimates and will provide insight into the kinetics of humoral immunity. Yet, despite an explosion in the number and availability of serologic assays to test for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, most have undergone minimal external validation to date. This hinders assay selection and implementation, as well as interpretation of study results. In addition, critical knowledge gaps remain regarding serologic correlates of protection from infection or disease, and the degree to which these assays cross-react with antibodies against related coronaviruses. This article discusses key use cases for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection tests and their application to serologic studies, reviews currently available assays, highlights key areas of ongoing research, and proposes potential strategies for test implementation.",

Our research was conducted at the 1st Department of Surgery, Semmelweis University, Budapest between 2006 and 2016, retrospectively. We analysed the LCs and converted LCs performed at our Department and as well as cases where the primary operations were conducted at other institutions but they were unable to provide the adequate therapy for the injury, thus the patients were transferred to our institution. At the 1st Department of Surgery complications occurred in 0,66% (30/4885) of all LCs. 327 converted LCs were done, complications occurred in 26 (7.95%) times. 22 patients were transferred to the 1st Department of Surgery from other institutions. Bilio-vascular injuries occurred in 61% (41/78). ERCP was performed in 25 cases with a 92% success rate. Reoperation was needed in 41% (28/41). Biliary reconstruction during the reoperation was performed via hepaticojejunostomy in 82% of all reoperations. The therapeutic solutions of LC's complications are complex. Therefore, the treatment is recommended only in institutions with appropriate experience."

      "Inhibition of BmNPV replication in Bombyx mori cell by dsRNA triggered RNA interference RNA interference (RNAi) causes degradation of targeted endogenous RNA in many diverse organisms. To investigate the effect of dsRNA on silkworm cells, we transfected three kinds of synthetic dsRNAs of 435 bp(Ap(1)), 300 bp(Ap(2)) and 399 bp(A(H)) in length against the various regions of BmNPV\u2019s DNA polymerase gene and DNA helicase gene, which are indispensable for viral replication in silkworm cells by TransMessenger(TM) transfection Reagent. Results indicated that in the experiment where silkworm cells were infected with wild-strain BmNPV of the three dsRNAs, Ap(2) and A(H) can effectively suppress the replication of virus, but Ap(1) had no effect on the inhibition of viral replication. Ap(2) and A(H) can reduce the infective titer of BmNPV with a peak change of approximately 3\u20134 logs on day 4 post-infection. The results of reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and DNA dot blotting also indicated that the expression level of the two target genes and the quantity of viral DNA both distinctly decreased under the influence of Ap(2) or A(H). Furthermore, using fluorescence microscopy we analyzed the distribution patterns of dsRNA. Our studies revealed that a majority of dsRNA was localized in the nuclear periphery discontinuously after 24 h of transfection.",
      "COVID-19 related mortality and spread of disease in long-term care: first findings from a living systematic review of emerging evidence Background: Policy responses to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on long-term care (LTC) require robust and timely evidence on mortality and spread of the disease in these settings. The aim of this living systematic review is to synthesise early international evidence on mortality rates and incidence of COVID-19 among people who use and provide LTC. Methods: We report the initial findings of a living systematic review (CRD42020183557), including studies identified through database searches up to 29 May 2020. We searched seven databases (MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL Plus; Web of Science; Global Health; WHO COVID-19 Research Database; medRxiv) to identify all studies reporting primary data on COVID-19 related mortality and incidence of disease among LTC users and staff. We excluded studies not focusing on LTC. Included primary studies were critically appraised and results on number of deaths and COVID-19 related mortality rates, case fatality rates, and excess deaths (co-primary outcomes), as well as incidence of disease, hospitalisations, and ICU admissions were synthesised narratively. We further included official figures on number of deaths in LTC. Findings: A total of 30 study reports for 27 unique primary studies or outbreak reports were included. Outbreak investigations in LTC facilities found COVID-19 incidence rates of between 0.0% and 71.7% among residents and between 1.5% and 64.0% among staff. Mortality rates varied from 0.0% to 9.9% of all residents at outbreak facilities, with case fatality rates between 0.0% and 33.7%. In included studies, no LTC staff members had died. LTC residents accounted for between 0% (Hong Kong) and 82% (Canada) of COVID-related deaths, according to official figures. Interpretation: Long-term care users have been particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we found wide variation in spread of disease and mortality rates between outbreaks at individual LTC facilities. Further research into the factors determining successful prevention and containment of COVID-19 outbreaks is needed to protect long-term care users and staff.",
      "Comparison of two commercial molecular tests and a laboratory-developed modification of the CDC 2019-nCoV RT-PCR assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. We compared the ability of 2 commercial molecular amplification assays [RealTime SARS-CoV-2 on the m2000 (Abbott) (abbreviated ACOV) and ID NOW\u2122 COVID-19 (Abbott) (abbreviated IDNOW)] and a laboratory-developed test [modified CDC 2019-nCoV RT-PCR assay with RNA extraction by eMag\u00ae (bioM\u00e9rieux) and amplification on QuantStudio\u2122 6 or ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies) (abbreviated CDC COV)] to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in upper respiratory tract specimens. Discrepant results were adjudicated by medical record review. 200 nasopharyngeal swab specimens in viral transport medium (VTM) were collected from symptomatic patients between March 27 and April 9, 2020. Results were concordant for 167 specimens (83.5% overall agreement), including 94 positive and 73 negative specimens. The ACOV assay yielded 33 additional positive results, 25 of which were also positive by the CDC COV assay but not by the IDNOW assay. In a follow-up evaluation, 97 patients for whom a dry nasal swab specimen yielded negative results by IDNOW had a paired nasopharyngeal swab specimen collected in VTM and tested by the ACOV assay; SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 13 (13.4%) of these specimens. Medical record review deemed all discrepant results to be true positives. The IDNOW test was the easiest to perform and provided a result in the shortest time, but detected fewer cases of COVID-19. The ACOV assay detected more cases of COVID-19 than CDC COV or IDNOW assays.",
      "Association between chronic ACE inhibitor exposure and decreased odds of severe disease in patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) inhibitors may increase the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is the receptor for SARSCoV-2 Spike protein. The consequences of using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) during the COVID-19 pandemic are unknown. METHODS A retrospective cohort study aiming to identify the odds of severe disease (defined as either hospitalization of \u226514 days, admission to the intensive care unit, or death) associated with exposure to ACEi or ARB was conducted. Adult patients (age \u226518 years) with COVID-19 admitted to the \u0130stanbul Faculty of Medicine Corona Center between March 9 and May 11, 2020, were included. Chronic users of ACEi, ARB, or other antihypertensive drugs were matched according to age, sex, sick days before hospitalization, comorbidities, smoking, number of antihypertensive regimens, doxazosin use, furosemide use, and serum creatinine level. Odds ratios (OR) of having severe disease were calculated. RESULTS In total, 611 patients were admitted with COVID-19, confirmed by either reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or computed tomography (CT). There were 363 males, and the age ranged from 18 to 98 years, with an average age of 57\u00b115 years. Of these, 165 participants had severe disease (53 deaths, case fatality rate: 8.7%). Among those with hypertension (n=249), ARB exposure was compatible with decreased odds (OR=0.60, 95% CI: 0.27-1.36, p=0.31) of severe disease though not statistically significant, while ACEi exposure significantly reduced the risk of severe disease (OR=0.37, 95% CI: 0.15-0.87, p=0.03). ACEi exposure was associated with milder infiltrations seen on baseline CT, lower C-reactive protein and ferritin, higher monocytes, shorter hospitalization, and less requirement for specific empirical treatments (favipiravir and meropenem). CONCLUSION Our data suggest that exposure to ACEi drugs may have favorable effects in the context of COVID-19 pneumonia.",
      "Integrated urban services: Experience from four cities on different continents Abstract Rapid urbanization combined with climate change necessitates new types of urban services that make best use of science and technology. The Integrated Urban Hydro-Meteorological, Climate and Environmental Services and systems are a new initiative from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) that seeks to provide science-based integrated urban services supporting safe, healthy and resilient cities. Various cities have already started development and implementation of such Integrated Urban Services and successfully test and use them following specific requirements of local stakeholders. This paper demonstrates the novel concept and approach of Integrated Urban Hydro-Meteorological, Climate and Environmental Services (IUS) from a set of four case study cities: Hong Kong, Toronto, Mexico City and Paris, that use different IUS configurations with good existing practice. These cities represent a range of countries, climates and geophysical settings. The aggregate main joint similarities of the IUS in these cities and synergy of the cities' experience, achievements and research findings are presented, as well as identification of existing gaps in knowledge and further research needs. A list of potential criteria for identifying and classifying IUS demonstration cities is proposed. It will aid future, more detailed analysis of the IUS experience, and selection of additional demonstration cities.",
      "A two-year prospective study of small poultry flocks in Ontario, Canada, part 1: prevalence of viral and bacterial pathogens. In Ontario, within the past few years, there has been a marked increase in the number of non-commercial poultry flocks (referred to as \"small flocks\"). Small poultry flocks may act as a reservoir of avian and zoonotic pathogens, given the flocks' limited access to veterinary services, inadequate biosecurity practices, and increased risk of contact with wild birds. Despite these potential risks, there is a scarcity of data concerning the prevalence of poultry and zoonotic pathogens among these flocks. To assess the baseline prevalence of bacterial and viral infectious pathogens, prospective surveillance of small flock postmortem submissions to the Animal Health Laboratory was conducted over a 2-y period. With the owner's consent, a postmortem examination and pre-set tests for infectious agents were conducted. A total of 160 submissions, mainly chickens (84%), were received. Among bacterial pathogens, Brachyspira spp., Mycoplasma synoviae, Campylobacter spp., Mycoplasma gallisepticum, and Salmonella spp. were detected in 37%, 36%, 35%, 23%, and 3% of tested submissions, respectively. Among viral pathogens, infectious bronchitis virus, fowl adenovirus, infectious laryngotracheitis virus, avian reovirus, and infectious bursal disease virus were detected in 39%, 35%, 15%, 4%, and 1% of submissions, respectively. We detected non-virulent avian avulavirus 1 from two chickens in a single submission, and low-pathogenic H10N8 influenza A virus from a single turkey submission. Our study provides baseline prevalence of viral and bacterial pathogens circulating in Ontario small flocks and may help animal and human health professionals to educate small flock owners about disease prevention.",

      "Health-related concerns and precautions during the COVID-19 pandemic: A comparison of Canadians with and without underlying health conditions. BACKGROUND The risk of experiencing adverse outcomes from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), such as hospitalization, admission to intensive care units and death, is elevated for older individuals and those with certain underlying health conditions including diabetes, chronic conditions affecting lungs, heart or kidneys, and a compromised immune system. DATA AND METHODS Data collected between March 29 and April 3, 2020 from the Canadian Perspectives Survey Series 1: Impacts of COVID-19 (n=4,627) were used to estimate the prevalence of underlying health conditions, health concerns and precautionary behaviours among Canadians aged 15 or older living in the provinces. Multivariate analyses examined associations between these variables after accounting for age, sex and education. RESULTS Close to 1 in 4 Canadians (24%) had an underlying health condition that increased their risk of adverse outcomes from COVID-19. Overall, 36% of the population were very or extremely concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on their own health. Individuals with underlying health conditions had higher odds (odds ratio: 2.0, 95% confidence interval: 1.6 to 2.5) of being highly concerned than those without these conditions, after adjustment for demographic characteristics. High percentages of Canadians took precautions to reduce the risk of infection regardless of whether or not they had underlying health conditions. DISCUSSION Health status was associated with higher levels of concern for one's own health in the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most Canadians were taking precautions recommended by public health authorities to protect themselves and others.",
      "Exchange rate pass-through in deflation: The case of Taiwan Abstract This paper incorporates deflation in an analysis of the relationship between the exchange rate pass-through and inflation. Using a nonlinear model based on monthly data of Taiwan's import prices from 1981 to 2008, we find that the degree of exchange rate pass-through is increasing in deflation. The increase becomes smaller when the price of oil is excluded. Evidence for pass-through increasing in deflation has not previously been found in the existing literature and presents a new understanding of the pricing behavior of firms. Poor profits in deflation cause firms to pass through most of the cost of exchange rate changes to their products to avoid exiting the market.",
      "Projecting hospital utilization during the COVID-19 outbreaks in the United States In the wake of community coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission in the United States, there is a growing public health concern regarding the adequacy of resources to treat infected cases. Hospital beds, intensive care units (ICUs), and ventilators are vital for the treatment of patients with severe illness. To project the timing of the outbreak peak and the number of ICU beds required at peak, we simulated a COVID-19 outbreak parameterized with the US population demographics. In scenario analyses, we varied the delay from symptom onset to self-isolation, the proportion of symptomatic individuals practicing self-isolation, and the basic reproduction number R(0). Without self-isolation, when R(0) = 2.5, treatment of critically ill individuals at the outbreak peak would require 3.8 times more ICU beds than exist in the United States. Self-isolation by 20% of cases 24 h after symptom onset would delay and flatten the outbreak trajectory, reducing the number of ICU beds needed at the peak by 48.4% (interquartile range 46.4\u201350.3%), although still exceeding existing capacity. When R(0) = 2, twice as many ICU beds would be required at the peak of outbreak in the absence of self-isolation. In this scenario, the proportional impact of self-isolation within 24 h on reducing the peak number of ICU beds is substantially higher at 73.5% (interquartile range 71.4\u201375.3%). Our estimates underscore the inadequacy of critical care capacity to handle the burgeoning outbreak. Policies that encourage self-isolation, such as paid sick leave, may delay the epidemic peak, giving a window of time that could facilitate emergency mobilization to expand hospital capacity."

      "Effects of inspiratory muscle training in hemodialysis patients. INTRODUCTION Chronic kidney disease associated with hemodialysis can have a variety of musculoskeletal complications, in addition to repercussions in pulmonary function. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of inspiratory muscle training on inspiratory muscle strength, pulmonary function, and functional capacity in patients with chronic kidney failure undergoing hemodialysis. METHOD Non-controlled clinical trial, comprising 15 individuals diagnosed with chronic kidney failure and undergoing hemodialysis. Maximum inspiratory (PImax) and expiratory (PEmax) pressures were assessed by use of pressure vacuum meter reading. Pulmonary function was assessed by use of spirometry. Functional capacity was assessed by use of walked distance and oxygen consumption obtained in the six-minute walk test (6MWT). For eight weeks, the inspiratory muscle training (IMT) protocol was applied during hemodialysis sessions, with load set to 40% of PImax and weekly frequency of three alternate days. RESULTS A significant increase in the walked distance was observed after training (455.5 \u00b1 98 versus 557.8 \u00b1 121.0; p = 0.003). No statistically significant difference was observed in the other variables when comparing their pre- and posttraining values. CONCLUSION The study showed no statistically significant difference in respiratory muscle strength, pulmonary function, and oxygen consumption. An increase in the walked distance was observed in the 6MWT.",
      "Relationships between brain metabolite levels, functional connectivity, and negative mood in urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome patients compared to controls: A MAPP research network study. Until recently, the predominant pathology of chronic pelvic pain conditions was thought to reside in the peripheral tissues. However, mounting evidence from neuroimaging studies suggests an important role of the central nervous system in the pathogenesis of these conditions. In the present cross-sectional study, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) of the brain was conducted in female patients with urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS) to determine if they exhibit abnormal concentrations of brain metabolites (e.g. those indicative of heightened excitatory tone) in regions involved in the processing and modulation of pain, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the anterior and posterior insular cortices. Compared to a group of age-matched healthy subjects, there were significantly higher levels of choline (p = 0.006, uncorrected) in the ACC of UCPPS patients. ACC choline levels were therefore compared with the region's resting functional connectivity to the rest of the brain. Higher choline was associated with greater ACC-to-limbic system connectivity in UCPPS patients, contrasted with lower connectivity in controls (i.e. an interaction). In patients, ACC choline levels were also positively correlated with negative mood. ACC \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels were lower in UCPPS patients compared with controls (p = 0.02, uncorrected), but this did not meet statistical correction for the 4 separate regional comparisons of metabolites. These results are the first to uncover abnormal GABA and choline levels in the brain of UCPPS patients compared to controls. Low GABA levels have been identified in other pain syndromes and might contribute to CNS hyper-excitability in these conditions. The relationships between increased ACC choline levels, ACC-to-limbic connectivity, and negative mood in UCPPS patients suggest that this metabolite could be related to the affective symptomatology of this syndrome.",
      "Body fluids may contribute to human-to-human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2: evidence and practical experience BACKGROUND: In December 2019, an unbelievable outbreak of pneumonia associated with coronavirus was reported in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province. This virus was called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although much effort has been spent on clarifying the transmission route of SARS-CoV-2, but, very little evidence is available regarding the relationship between human body fluids and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Considerable evidence from hospital in Wuhan indicates that strict rules to avoid occupational exposure to patients\u2019 body fluids in healthcare settings, particularly among every medical staff, limited person-to-person transmission of nosocomial infections by direct or indirect contact. CONCLUSION: We tried to provide important information for understanding the possible transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 via body fluids including bronchoalveolar-lavage, saliva, blood, urine, feces, sputum, tears, and semen in order to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurrences.",
      "Conjunctivitis can be the only presenting sign and symptom of COVID-19 Abstract Five cases of non-remitting conjunctivitis turned out to be the sole presenting sign and symptom of COVID-19. These patients tested positive on RT-PCR of naso-pharyngeal swabs and developed no fever, malaise, or respiratory symptoms throughout the course of their illness. They all fully recovered. In the current efforts to fight the spread of this virus, authors want to emphasize that atypical clinical presentations of COVID-19 can occur and a high level of suspicion should be maintained. Ocular involvement and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should never be overlooked. In fact, conjunctival mucosae are susceptible to respiratory viruses and remain an important point of entry. For this reason, eye protection in the form of goggles or a face shield should be considered essential for all healthcare providers, even when taking care of patients who are not showing typical symptoms of COVID-19.",
      "Issues Concerning Survival of Viruses on Surfaces Viruses are the causative agents of an estimated 60% of human infections worldwide. The most common viral illnesses are produced by enteric and respiratory viruses. Transmission of these viruses from an infected person or animal to a new host can occur via several routes. Existing studies strongly suggest that contaminated fomites or surfaces play an important role in the spreading of viral diseases. The potential of viral spreading via contaminated surfaces depends particularly on the ability of the virus to maintain infectivity whilst it is in the environment. This is affected by a combination of biological, physical and chemical factors. This review summarises current knowledge about the influence of environmental factors on the survival and spread of viruses via contaminated surfaces.",

      "Longitudinal epidemiology of viral infectious diseases combining virus isolation, antigenic analysis and phylogenetic analysis as well as seroepidemiology in Yamagata, Japan between 1999 and 2018. We introduced a microplate method for virus isolation in the Department of Microbiology, Yamagata Prefectural Institute of Public Health (YPIPH) in 1999 in Yamagata, Japan. We have since carried out longitudinal epidemiological studies of viral infectious diseases, particularly, respiratory viruses, combining traditional technologies such as virus isolation and serological techniques and newly developed molecular methods. Here, we provide an overview of our activities at YPIPH between 1999 and 2018. During the study period, we observed emerging and re-merging diseases such as echovirus type 13, enterovirus D-68, parechovirus-A3 (PeV-A3), and Saffold virus. With regard to PeV-A3, we proposed a concept of new disease \"PeV-A3-associated myalgia/myositis\". We also revealed longitudinal epidemiologies for several viruses such as enterovirus A71 and coxsackievirus A16. To perform longitudinal epidemiological studies at any time in Yamagata, we established our system for stocking clinical specimens, viral isolates, complementary DNAs and serum specimens. We also pursued collaboration works with virology laboratories across Japan. We hope our experiences, findings and research materials will further contribute to the development of countermeasures against viral infectious diseases and improvement in public health strategies in Yamagata, Japan, Asia and around the world.",
      "Molecular advances in the cell biology of SARS-CoV and current disease prevention strategies In the aftermath of the SARS epidemic, there has been significant progress in understanding the molecular and cell biology of SARS-CoV. Some of the milestones are the availability of viral genome sequence, identification of the viral receptor, development of an infectious cDNA clone, and the identification of viral antigens that elicit neutralizing antibodies. However, there is still a large gap in our understanding of how SARS-CoV interacts with the host cell and the rapidly changing viral genome adds another variable to this equation. Now the SARS-CoV story has entered a new phase, a search for preventive strategies and a cure for the disease. This review highlights the progress made in identifying molecular aspects of SARS-CoV biology that is relevant in developing disease prevention strategies. Authors conclude that development of successful SARS-CoV vaccines and antivirals depends on the progress we make in these areas in the immediate future.",
      "Effect of Environmental Conditions on SARS-CoV-2 Stability in Human Nasal Mucus and Sputum We found that environmental conditions affect the stability of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in nasal mucus and sputum. The virus is more stable at low-temperature and low-humidity conditions, whereas warmer temperature and higher humidity shortened half-life. Although infectious virus was undetectable after 48 hours, viral RNA remained detectable for 7 days.",
      "COVID-19 and gastrointestinal endoscopies: Current insights and emergent strategies A new coronavirus emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan city of China, named as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease was called coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The infection due to this virus spread exponentially throughout China and then spread across >205 nations, including the United States (US). Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopies are routinely performed in the US and globally. Previous reports of isolated infection outbreaks were reported with endoscopes acting as potential vectors. While multidrug-resistant organisms have been reported to be spread by endoscopes, few cases of viruses such as hepatitis B and C are noted in the literature. COVID-19 is predominately spread by droplet transmission, although recent evidence has showed that shedding in feces and feco-oral transmission could also be possible. It is unclear if COVID-19 could be transmitted by endoscopes, but it could theoretically happen due to contact with mucous membranes and body fluids. GI endoscopies involve close contact with oral and colonic contents exposing endoscopy staff to respiratory and oropharyngeal secretions. This can increase the risk of contamination and contribute to virus transmission. Given these risks, all major GI societies have called for rescheduling elective non-urgent procedures and perform only emergent or urgent procedures based on the clinical need. Furthermore, pre-screening of all individuals prior to endoscopy is recommended. This article focuses on the risk of COVID-19 transmission by GI shedding, the potential role of endoscopes as a vector of this novel virus, including transmission during endoscopies, and prevention strategies including deferral of elective non-urgent endoscopy procedures."

      "Development of a rapid immunochromatographic assay for detection of antibodies against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. An immunochromatographic test strip was developed for the detection of antibodies against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in porcine serum. In this test, the recombinant nucleocapsid protein of PEDV was expressed in soluble form and purified by using Ni-NTA resin and gel filtration chromatography. The purified recombinant N protein conjugated with colloidal gold was dispensed on a conjugate pad as the detector. Staphylococcal protein A and rabbit anti-N protein IgG were blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane for the test and control lines, respectively. The immunochromatographic test strip specifically detected PEDV antibodies within 10 min and had higher sensitivity (96.0%) and specificity (90.8%) than those of commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Our newly developed strip has great potential for the early diagnosis of PEDV infection.",
      "SARS-Coronavirus Replication/Transcription Complexes Are Membrane-Protected and Need a Host Factor for Activity In Vitro SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication and transcription are mediated by a replication/transcription complex (RTC) of which virus-encoded, non-structural proteins (nsps) are the primary constituents. The 16 SARS-CoV nsps are produced by autoprocessing of two large precursor polyproteins. The RTC is believed to be associated with characteristic virus-induced double-membrane structures in the cytoplasm of SARS-CoV-infected cells. To investigate the link between these structures and viral RNA synthesis, and to dissect RTC organization and function, we isolated active RTCs from infected cells and used them to develop the first robust assay for their in vitro activity. The synthesis of genomic RNA and all eight subgenomic mRNAs was faithfully reproduced by the RTC in this in vitro system. Mainly positive-strand RNAs were synthesized and protein synthesis was not required for RTC activity in vitro. All RTC activity, enzymatic and putative membrane-spanning nsps, and viral RNA cosedimented with heavy membrane structures. Furthermore, the pelleted RTC required the addition of a cytoplasmic host factor for reconstitution of its in vitro activity. Newly synthesized subgenomic RNA appeared to be released, while genomic RNA remained predominantly associated with the RTC-containing fraction. RTC activity was destroyed by detergent treatment, suggesting an important role for membranes. The RTC appeared to be protected by membranes, as newly synthesized viral RNA and several replicase/transcriptase subunits were protease- and nuclease-resistant and became susceptible to degradation only upon addition of a non-ionic detergent. Our data establish a vital functional dependence of SARS-CoV RNA synthesis on virus-induced membrane structures.",
      "Interferon-Gamma Modulation of the Local T Cell Response to Alphavirus Encephalomyelitis Infection of mice with Sindbis virus (SINV) provides a model for examining the role of the immune response to alphavirus infection of the central nervous system (CNS). Interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) is an important component of this response, and we show that SINV-infected differentiated neurons respond to IFN-\u03b3 in vitro by induction of antiviral genes and suppression of virus replication. To determine the in vivo effects of IFN-\u03b3 on SINV clearance and T cell responses, C57BL/6 mice lacking IFN-\u03b3 or IFN-\u03b3 receptor-1 were compared to wild-type (WT) mice after intracranial SINV infection. In WT mice, IFN-\u03b3 was first produced in the CNS by natural killer cells and then by CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Mice with impaired IFN-\u03b3 signaling initiated clearance of viral RNA earlier than WT mice associated with CNS entry of more granzyme B-producing CD8(+) T cells. However, these mice established fewer CD8(+) tissue-resident memory T (T(RM)) cells and were more likely to experience reactivation of viral RNA synthesis late after infection. Therefore, IFN-\u03b3 suppresses the local development of granzyme B-expressing CD8(+) T cells and slows viral RNA clearance but promotes CD8(+) T(RM) cell establishment.",

      "The SARS, MERS and novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemics, the newest and biggest global health threats: what lessons have we learned? OBJECTIVES: To provide an overview of the three major deadly coronaviruses and identify areas for improvement of future preparedness plans, as well as provide a critical assessment of the risk factors and actionable items for stopping their spread, utilizing lessons learned from the first two deadly coronavirus outbreaks, as well as initial reports from the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic in Wuhan, China. METHODS: Utilizing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA) website, and a comprehensive review of PubMed literature, we obtained information regarding clinical signs and symptoms, treatment and diagnosis, transmission methods, protection methods and risk factors for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19. Comparisons between the viruses were made. RESULTS: Inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation, and limited reporting on the virus within China has, in part, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout mainland China and into proximal and distant countries. Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due in part to increased globalization and the focus of the epidemic. Wuhan, China is a large hub connecting the North, South, East and West of China via railways and a major international airport. The availability of connecting flights, the timing of the outbreak during the Chinese (Lunar) New Year, and the massive rail transit hub located in Wuhan has enabled the virus to perforate throughout China, and eventually, globally. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that we did not learn from the two prior epidemics of coronavirus and were ill-prepared to deal with the challenges the COVID-19 epidemic has posed. Future research should attempt to address the uses and implications of internet of things (IoT) technologies for mapping the spread of infection.",

      "Factors affecting the chemical composition of precipitation in Syria Concentrations of the major ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, NH4+, Cl-, HCO3-, SO42- and NO3-), pH and electrical conductivity (EC) values in the rainwater (RW) samples at 16 stations in Syria were determined for characterizing the principal factors affecting the chemical composition of precipitation (P) in this country. Collection of the RW samples was made on a monthly basis during the period (1989-2006). The volume-weighted mean (VWM) values calculated for the different parameters at all stations show VWM values of 6.84 and 96 \u00b5S/cm for pH and EC, respectively. The ionic trend of the VWM concentrations (\u00b5eq/L) in the RW samples of entire dataset follows the descending order: Ca2+ &#8805; HCO3- > SO42- > Mg2+ > Cl- > Na+ > NO3- > K+ > NH4+. The lowest pH and EC values were found for the southern mountainous stations, while the highest were reported for the interior inland stations, depending on the amount of carbonate dust present in the atmosphere. The major part of the RW salinity (> 70%) was due to Ca2+, HCO3- and SO42- concentrations. The highest concentrations of Na+ and Cl- were found for the Tartous coastal station, where the Na+/Cl- ratio (0.84 \u00b1 0.16) was remarkably very close to that of the Mediterranean Sea (MS) value (0.86), implying thus the sea spray effect. The highest NO3- concentrations (&#8776; 8-9 mg/L), with relatively high SO42-/NO3- ratios (> 2 \u00b1 1), were found for the major cities (Damascus, Homs and Aleppo), implying hence the influence of intensive traffics and urban pollutions. The pH parameter was moderately linked with Ca2+ and HCO3- (R2 &#8776; 0.36), while EC was correlated with all ions, except NH4+. This later ion was weakly correlated with NO3- (R2 &#8776; 0.23). Strong correlations were found between Ca2+ and SO42- (R2 &#8776; 0.80) and between Cl- and Na+ (R2 &#8776; 0.95). Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions were the most responsible for neutralizing the RW acidity. The role of K+ and NH4+ as acidity neutralizers was small. By using the principal component analysis (PCA), five major factors, explaining &#8776; 87% of the total variance, were suggested for the possible sources affecting the chemical composition of RW in this country. The factors are (1) crustal natural materials, (2) sea salts, (3) fossil fuel combustion, (4) rural activity, and (5) biomass burning.",
      "CLARITY for High-resolution Imaging and Quantification of Vasculature in the Whole Mouse Brain. Elucidating the normal structure and distribution of cerebral vascular system is fundamental for understanding its function. However, studies on visualization and whole-brain quantification of vasculature with cellular resolution are limited. Here, we explored the structure of vasculature at the whole-brain level using the newly developed CLARITY technique. Adult male C57BL/6J mice undergoing transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and Tie2-RFP transgenic mice were used. Whole mouse brains were extracted for CLARITY processing. Immunostaining was performed to label vessels. Customized MATLAB code was used for image processing and quantification. Three-dimensional images were visualized using the Vaa3D software. Our results showed that whole mouse brain became transparent using the CLARITY method. Three-dimensional imaging and visualization of vasculature were achieved at the whole-brain level with a 1-\u03bcm voxel resolution. The quantitative results showed that the fractional vascular volume was 0.018 \u00b1 0.004 mm3 per mm3, the normalized vascular length was 0.44 \u00b1 0.04 m per mm3, and the mean diameter of the microvessels was 4.25 \u00b1 0.08 \u03bcm. Furthermore, a decrease in the fractional vascular volume and a decrease in the normalized vascular length were found in the penumbra of ischemic mice compared to controls (p < 0.05). In conclusion, CLARITY provides a novel approach for mapping vasculature in the whole mouse brain at cellular resolution. CLARITY-optimized algorithms facilitate the assessment of structural change in vasculature after brain injury.",
      "Aerosol Filtration Efficiency of Common Fabrics Used in Respiratory Cloth Masks The emergence of a pandemic affecting the respiratory system can result in a significant demand for face masks. This includes the use of cloth masks by large sections of the public, as can be seen during the current global spread of COVID-19. However, there is limited knowledge available on the performance of various commonly available fabrics used in cloth masks. Importantly, there is a need to evaluate filtration efficiencies as a function of aerosol particulate sizes in the 10 nm to 10 \u00b5m range, which is particularly relevant for respiratory virus transmission. We have carried out these studies for several common fabrics including cotton, silk, chiffon, flannel, various synthetics, and their combinations. Although the filtration efficiencies for various fabrics when a single layer was used ranged from 5 to 80% and 5 to 95% for particle sizes of <300 nm and >300 nm, respectively, the efficiencies improved when multiple layers were used and when using a specific combination of different fabrics. Filtration efficiencies of the hybrids (such as cotton-silk, cotton-chiffon, cotton-flannel) was >80% (for particles <300 nm) and >90% (for particles >300 nm). We speculate that the enhanced performance of the hybrids is likely due to the combined effect of mechanical and electrostatic-based filtration. Cotton, the most widely used material for cloth masks performs better at higher weave densities (i.e., thread count) and can make a significant difference in filtration efficiencies. Our studies also imply that gaps (as caused by an improper fit of the mask) can result in over a 60% decrease in the filtration efficiency, implying the need for future cloth mask design studies to take into account issues of \"fit\" and leakage, while allowing the exhaled air to vent efficiently. Overall, we find that combinations of various commonly available fabrics used in cloth masks can potentially provide significant protection against the transmission of aerosol particles.",
      "Decontamination of surgical face masks and N95 respirators by dry heat pasteurization for one hour at 70\u00b0C BACKGROUND: The need for protective masks greatly exceeds their global supply during the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We optimized the temperature used in the dry heat pasteurization method to destroy pathogens and decontaminate masks while retaining their filtering capacity. RESULTS: The current study showed that dry heat at both 60\u00b0C and 70\u00b0C for 1 hour could successfully kill 6 species of respiratory bacteria and one fungi species, and inactivate the H1N1 indicator virus. After being heated at 70\u00b0C for 1, 2, and 3 hours, the N95 respirators and surgical face masks showed no changes in their shape and components. The filtering efficiency of bacterial aerosol for N95 respirators were 98%, 98%, and 97% after being heated for 1, 2, and 3 hour, respectively, all of which were over the 95% efficiency required and similar to the value before being heated (99%). The filtering efficiency for surgical face masks was 97%, 97%, and 96% for 1, 2, and 3 hours of heating, respectively, all of which were also similar to the value before being heated (97%). CONCLUSIONS: This method can be used at home and can significantly resolve the current shortage of masks.",
      "Surgical mask partition reduces the risk of non-contact transmission in a golden Syrian hamster model for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is believed to be mostly transmitted by medium-to-large sized respiratory droplets although airborne transmission is theoretically possible in healthcare settings involving aerosol-generating procedures. Exposure to respiratory droplets can theoretically be reduced by surgical mask usage. However, there is a lack of experimental evidence supporting surgical mask usage for prevention of COVID-19. METHODS: We used a well-established golden Syrian hamster SARS-CoV-2 model. We placed SARS-CoV-2-challenged index hamsters and na\u00efve hamsters into closed system units each comprising two different cages separated by a polyvinyl chloride air porous partition with unidirectional airflow within the isolator. The effect of a surgical mask partition placed in between the cages was investigated. Besides clinical scoring, hamster specimens were tested for viral load, histopathology, and viral nucleocapsid antigen expression. RESULTS: Non-contact transmission was found in 66.7% (10/15) of exposed na\u00efve hamsters. Surgical mask partition for challenged index or na\u00efve hamsters significantly reduced transmission to 25% (6/24, P=0.018). Surgical mask partition for challenged index hamsters significantly reduced transmission to only 16.7% (2/12, P=0.019) of exposed na\u00efve hamsters. Unlike the severe COVID-19 manifestations of challenged hamsters, infected na\u00efve hamsters had lower clinical scores, milder histopathological changes, and lower viral nucleocapsid antigen expression in respiratory tract tissues. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by respiratory droplets or airborne droplet nuclei in the hamster model. Such transmission could be reduced by surgical mask usage, especially when masks were worn by infected individuals.",

      "Comparative proteomic analysis of cauliflower under high temperature and flooding stresses Abstract High-temperature and waterlogging are major abiotic stresses that affect the yield and quality of cauliflower. Cauliflower cultivars \u2018H41\u2019 and \u2018H69\u2019 are tolerant to high temperature and flooding, respectively; however, \u2018H71\u2019 is sensitive to both stresses. The objectives of this study were to identify the proteins that were differentially regulated and the physiological changes that occurred during different time periods in \u2018H41\u2019, \u2018H69\u2019, and \u2018H71\u2019 when responding to treatments of flooding, 40\u00b0C, and both stresses combined. Changes in the leaf proteome were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and identified by Mascot peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) and database searching. Stress treatments caused significant reductions in electrolyte leakage, chlorophyll fluorescence Fv/Fm, chlorophyll content, and water potential as stress times were prolonged. By the comparative proteomic analysis, 85 protein peaks that were differentially expressed in response to combination treatments at 0, 6, and 24h, 69 (33 in \u2018H41\u2019, 29 in \u2018H69\u2019, and 9 in \u2018H71\u2019) were identified, of which were cultivar specific. Differentially regulated proteins predominantly functioned in photosynthesis and to a lesser extent in energy metabolism, cellular homeostasis, transcription and translation, signal transduction, and protein biosynthesis. This is the first report that utilizes proteomics to discover changes in the protein expression profile of cauliflower in response to heat and flooding.",
      "Correlation of microbiological yield with radiographic activity on chest computed tomography in cases of suspected pulmonary tuberculosis BACKGROUND: Little is known about the correlation between microbiological yield and radiographic activity, on chest computed tomography (CT), in suspected pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) cases, despite CT being widely used, clinically. METHODS: We used multicenter retrospective data, obtained from medical records, focusing on the diagnostic performance for definite PTB. We categorized patients into four groups, by radiographic activity: definitely active, probably active, indeterminate activity, and probably inactive. RESULTS: Of the 650 patients included, 316 had culture-confirmed PTB; 190 (29.2%), 323 (49.7%), 70 (10.8%), and 67 (10.3%) were classified into the definitely active, probably active, indeterminate activity, and probably inactive groups, respectively. The corresponding observed culture rates for CT radiographic activity were 61.6%, 60.7%, 4.3% and 0%, respectively. When not only culture rates but TB-PCR and histological results were taken into consideration as definite PTB, it showed 66.6%, 67.2%, 14.3%, and 0% of each CT radiographic activity, respectively. Regarding the diagnostic performance for definite PTB, radiographic activity displayed high sensitivity (97.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI), 94.6\u201398.5) and negative predictive values (92.7%, 95% CI, 86.6\u201396.2), considered definitely and probably active PTB. Apart from PTB, other etiologies, according to radiographic activity, were predominantly respiratory infections such as bacterial pneumonia and non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection. CONCLUSIONS: Radiographic activity showed good diagnostic performance, and can be used easily in clinical practice. However, clinicians should consider other possibilities, because radiologic images do not confirm microbiological PTB."

      "Temperature Decreases Spread Parameters of the New Covid-19 Case Dynamics (1) Background: The virulence of coronavirus diseases due to viruses like SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV decreases in humid and hot weather. The putative temperature dependence of infectivity by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 or covid-19 has a high predictive medical interest. (2) Methods: External temperature and new covid-19 cases in 21 countries and in the French administrative regions were collected from public data. Associations between epidemiological parameters of the new case dynamics and temperature were examined using an ARIMA model. (3) Results: We show that, in the first stages of the epidemic, the velocity of contagion decreases with country- or region-wise temperature. (4) Conclusions: Results indicate that high temperatures diminish initial contagion rates, but seasonal temperature effects at later stages of the epidemy remain questionable. Confinement policies and other eviction rules should account for climatological heterogeneities, in order to adapt the public health decisions to possible geographic or seasonal gradients.",
      "Association between climate variables and global transmission oF SARS-CoV-2 Abstract In this study, we aimed at analyzing the associations between transmission of and deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2 and meteorological variables, such as average temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and precipitation. Two outcome measures were considered, with the first aiming to study SARS-CoV-2 infections and the second aiming to study COVID-19 mortality. Daily data as well as data on SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 mortality obtained between December 1, 2019 and March 28, 2020 were collected from weather stations around the world. The country's population density and time of exposure to the disease were used as control variables. Finally, a month dummy variable was added. Daily data by country were analyzed using the panel data model. An increase in the average daily temperature by one degree Fahrenheit reduced the number of cases by approximately 6.4 cases/day. There was a negative correlation between the average temperature per country and the number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections. This association remained strong even with the incorporation of additional variables and controls (maximum temperature, average temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation) and fixed country effects. There was a positive correlation between precipitation and SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Countries with higher rainfall measurements showed an increase in disease transmission. For each average inch/day, there was an increase of 56.01 cases/day. COVID-19 mortality showed no significant association with temperature.",
      "Targeting SARS-CoV-2: a systematic drug repurposing approach to identify promising inhibitors against 3C-like proteinase and 2\u2032-O-ribose methyltransferase The recent pandemic associated with SARS-CoV-2, a virus of the Coronaviridae family, has resulted in an unprecedented number of infected people. The highly contagious nature of this virus makes it imperative for us to identify promising inhibitors from pre-existing antiviral drugs. Two druggable targets, namely 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) and 2\u2032-O-ribose methyltransferase (2\u2032-O-MTase) were selected in this study due to their indispensable nature in the viral life cycle. 3CLpro is a cysteine protease responsible for the proteolysis of replicase polyproteins resulting in the formation of various functional proteins, whereas 2\u2032-O-MTase methylates the ribose 2\u2032-O position of the first and second nucleotide of viral mRNA, which sequesters it from the host immune system. The selected drug target proteins were screened against an in-house library of 123 antiviral drugs. Two promising drug molecules were identified for each protein based on their estimated free energy of binding (\u0394G), the orientation of drug molecules in the active site and the interacting residues. The selected protein-drug complexes were then subjected to MD simulation, which consists of various structural parameters to equivalently reflect their physiological state. From the virtual screening results, two drug molecules were selected for each drug target protein [Paritaprevir (\u0394G = \u22129.8 kcal/mol) & Raltegravir (\u0394G = \u22127.8 kcal/mol) for 3CLpro and Dolutegravir (\u0394G = \u22129.4 kcal/mol) and Bictegravir (\u0394G = \u22128.4 kcal/mol) for 2\u2032-OMTase]. After the extensive computational analysis, we proposed that Raltegravir, Paritaprevir, Bictegravir and Dolutegravir are excellent lead candidates for these crucial proteins and they could become potential therapeutic drugs against SARS-CoV-2.

      "SARS\u2010CoV\u20102: Structural diversity, phylogeny, and potential animal host identification of spike glycoprotein To investigate the evolutionary history of the current pandemic outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102), a total of 137 genomes of coronavirus strains with release dates between January 2019 and 25 March 2020, were analyzed. To investigate the potential intermediate host of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, we analyzed spike glycoprotein sequences from different animals, with particular emphasis on bats. We performed phylogenetic analysis and structural reconstruction of the spike glycoproteins with subsequent alignment and comparison. Our phylogenetic results revealed that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was more similar to the bats' betacoronavirus isolates: HKU5\u2010related from Pipistrellus abramus and HKU4\u2010related from Tylonycteris pachypus. We also identified a yak betacoronavirus strain, YAK/HY24/CH/2017, as the closest match in the comparison of the structural models of spike glycoproteins. Interestingly, a set of unique features has been described for this particular strain of the yak betacoronavirus. Therefore, our results suggest that the human SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, responsible for the current outbreak of COVID\u201019, could also come from yak as an intermediate host.",

      "Less Wrong COVID-19 Projections With Interactive Assumptions COVID-19 pandemic is an enigma with uncertainty caused by biological and health systems factors. Although many models have been developed all around the world, transparent models that allow interacting with the assumptions will become more important as we test various strategies for lockdown, testing and social interventions and enable effective policy decisions. In this paper we developed a suite of models to guide development of policies under different scenarios when the lockdown opens. These had been deployed to create an interactive dashboard called COVision which includes the Agent based Models (ABM) and classical compartmental models i.e Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) and Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) approaches. Our tool allows simulation of scenarios by changing strength of lockdown, basic reproduction number(R0), asymptomatic spread, testing rate, contact rate (Beta), recovery rate (Gamma), incubation period and starting number of cases. We optimized ABMs and classical compartmental models to fit the actual data, both of which performed well in terms of R-squared, root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Out of the three models in our suite, ABM was able to capture the data better than SIR and SEIR and achieved an RSQ of 92.3% for India and 89% for Maharashtra for the next 30 days. We also computed R0 using SIR and SEIR models which were found to be decreasing over the different periods of lockdown indicating the effectiveness of policies and interventions. Finally, we formulated ICU bed requirements using our best models. Our evaluation suggests that ABM models were able to capture the dynamic nature of the epidemic for a longer duration of time while classical SIR and SEIR models performed inefficiently for longer terms. The visual interactivity and ability to simulate outcomes under different parameters will allow the policymakers to make informed decisions for estimating the strength of lockdown to be implemented and testing rates. Further, our models were able to highlight the differences at state level for the parameters such as R0 and contact rates and hence can be applied for state specific decision making.

      "Distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic and Its Monthly Forecast Based on Seasonal Climate Patterns This paper investigates whether the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic could have been favored by specific weather conditions and other factors. It is found that the 2020 winter weather in the region of Wuhan (Hubei, Central China)-where the virus first broke out in December and spread widely from January to February 2020-was strikingly similar to that of the Northern Italian provinces of Milan, Brescia and Bergamo, where the pandemic broke out from February to March. The statistical analysis was extended to cover the United States of America, which overtook Italy and China as the country with the highest number of confirmed COronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19) cases, and then to the entire world. The found correlation patterns suggest that the COVID-19 lethality significantly worsens (4 times on average) under weather temperatures between 4 &#8728; C and 12 &#8728; C and relative humidity between 60% and 80%. Possible co-factors such as median population age and air pollution were also investigated suggesting an important influence of the former but not of the latter, at least, on a synoptic scale. Based on these results, specific isotherm world maps were generated to locate, month by month, the world regions that share similar temperature ranges. From February to March, the 4-12 &#8728; C isotherm zone extended mostly from Central China toward Iran, Turkey, West-Mediterranean Europe (Italy, Spain and France) up to the United State of America, optimally coinciding with the geographic regions most affected by the pandemic from February to March. It is predicted that in the spring, as the weather gets warm, the pandemic will likely worsen in northern regions (United Kingdom, Germany, East Europe, Russia and North America) while the situation will likely improve in the southern regions (Italy and Spain). However, in autumn, the pandemic could come back and affect the same regions again. The Tropical Zone and the entire Southern Hemisphere, but in restricted colder southern regions, could avoid a strong pandemic because of the sufficiently warm weather during the entire year and because of the lower median age of their population.

      "Increased Detection coupled with Social Distancing and Health Capacity Planning Reduce the Burden of COVID-19 Cases and Fatalities: A Proof of Concept Study using a Stochastic Computational Simulation Model Objective: In absence of any vaccine, the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is being contained through a non-pharmaceutical measure termed Social Distancing (SD). However, whether SD alone is enough to flatten the epidemic curve is debatable. Using a Stochastic Computational Simulation Model, we investigated the impact of increasing SD, hospital beds and COVID-19 detection rates in preventing COVID-19 cases and fatalities. Research Design and Methods: The Stochastic Simulation Model was built using the EpiModel package in R. As a proof of concept study, we ran the simulation on Kasaragod, the most affected district in Kerala. We added 3 compartments to the SEIR model to obtain a SEIQHRF (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Quarantined-Hospitalised-Recovered-Fatal) model. Results: Implementing SD only delayed the appearance of peak prevalence of COVID-19 cases. Doubling of hospital beds could not reduce the fatal cases probably due to its overwhelming number compared to the hospital beds. Increasing detection rates could significantly flatten the curve and reduce the peak prevalence of cases (increasing detection rate by 5 times could reduce case number to half). Conclusions: An effective strategy to contain the epidemic spread of COVID-19 in India is to increase detection rates in combination with SD measures and increase in hospital beds.",
      "Special report: Early use of ICD-10-CM code \"U07.1, COVID-19\" to identify 2019 novel coronavirus cases in Military Health System administrative data. This report describes early exploratory analysis of ICD-10-CM code U07.1 (2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease [COVID-19]) to assess the use of administrative data for case ascertainment, syndromic surveillance, and future epidemiological studies. Out of the 2,950 possible COVID-19 cases identified between 1 April 2020 and 4 May 2020, 600 (20.3%) were detected in the Defense Medical Surveillance System (DMSS) and not in the Disease Reporting System internet (DRSi) or in Health Level 7 laboratory data from the Composite Health Care System. Among the 150 out of 600 cases identified exclusively in the DMSS and selected for Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA) review, 16 (10.7%) had a certified positive lab result in AHLTA, 17 (11.3%) met Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) criteria for a probable case, 46 (30.7%) were not cases based on CSTE criteria, and 71 (47.3%) had evidence of a positive lab result from an outside source.

      "The SARS, MERS and novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemics, the newest and biggest global health threats: what lessons have we learned? OBJECTIVES: To provide an overview of the three major deadly coronaviruses and identify areas for improvement of future preparedness plans, as well as provide a critical assessment of the risk factors and actionable items for stopping their spread, utilizing lessons learned from the first two deadly coronavirus outbreaks, as well as initial reports from the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic in Wuhan, China. METHODS: Utilizing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA) website, and a comprehensive review of PubMed literature, we obtained information regarding clinical signs and symptoms, treatment and diagnosis, transmission methods, protection methods and risk factors for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19. Comparisons between the viruses were made. RESULTS: Inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation, and limited reporting on the virus within China has, in part, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout mainland China and into proximal and distant countries. Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due in part to increased globalization and the focus of the epidemic. Wuhan, China is a large hub connecting the North, South, East and West of China via railways and a major international airport. The availability of connecting flights, the timing of the outbreak during the Chinese (Lunar) New Year, and the massive rail transit hub located in Wuhan has enabled the virus to perforate throughout China, and eventually, globally. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that we did not learn from the two prior epidemics of coronavirus and were ill-prepared to deal with the challenges the COVID-19 epidemic has posed. Future research should attempt to address the uses and implications of internet of things (IoT) technologies for mapping the spread of infection.",
      "[Prognostic analysis of lung function and chest X-ray changes of 258 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome in rehabilitation after discharge]. OBJECTIVE To analyze the clinical characteristics and prognostic changes of rehabilitating severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients through regular lung function tests and lung imaging studies after discharge and to retrospectively analyze the treatment data of these patients. METHODS 258 discharged SARS patients received regular SARS-Co virus IgG test, lung function test and chest X-ray and/or high resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) examination at General Hospital of PLA two months after discharge, and the treatment data of these patients were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS 80.6% patients (208 of 258 patients) were positive for SARS-Co virus IgG. 21.3% patients (55 of 258 patients) showed lung diffusion abnormity (D(LCO) < 80%pred). Compared to 155 SARS-Co virus IgG positive patients without lung diffusion abnormity and 50 SARS-Co virus IgG negative patients, the 53 SARS-Co virus IgG positive patients with lung diffusion abnormity had longer fever course, higher dosages of glucocorticoid therapy, higher percentage of oxygen therapy and non-invasive ventilation. 51 of the 53 patients with lung diffusion abnormity received lung function test after one month, and the results of D(LCO) improved in 80.4% patients (41 of 51 patients). 40 of 51 patients with lung diffusion abnormity showed lung fibrosis, and the fibrosis decreased in 55% patients (22 of 40 patients) after one month. CONCLUSIONS This finding suggests that lung fibrosis caused by SARS mostly occurs in severe patients, and it can resolve spontaneously. D(LCO) may be more sensitive than HRCT in evaluating the fibrotic changes.",
      "A fatal case associated with respiratory syncytial virus infection in a young child BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral cause of pediatric bronchiolitis and pneumonia worldwide. Risk factors for high mortality and prolonged morbidity after RSV infection include premature birth, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, congenital heart disease, and Down syndrome. However, some previously healthy, full-term children who are infected with RSV also require hospitalization and even experience severe sequelae or death. CASE PRESENTATION: In this report, we present the case of an RSV-associated death of a child who was born at full-term and developed normally up to the age of 2 years old. Cardiopulmonary arrest occurred within 3 days after the onset of symptoms, which included cough and high fever. Complete brain edema was prominent, and encephalopathy was developing. Viral antigen detection and microbiome analyses of oral swab and nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens verified an RSV infection, while bacterial culture of blood specimens yielded negative results. The RSV strain detected in this patient was subtyped as RSVB9, and no mutation was found in the six antigenic sites for targeted drugs or vaccines. CONCLUSIONS: The patient had a severe infection associated with RSV, which was very likely the cause of her central nervous system infection and acute neurological complications.",
      "COVID-19 related mortality and spread of disease in long-term care: first findings from a living systematic review of emerging evidence Background: Policy responses to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on long-term care (LTC) require robust and timely evidence on mortality and spread of the disease in these settings. The aim of this living systematic review is to synthesise early international evidence on mortality rates and incidence of COVID-19 among people who use and provide LTC. Methods: We report the initial findings of a living systematic review (CRD42020183557), including studies identified through database searches up to 29 May 2020. We searched seven databases (MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL Plus; Web of Science; Global Health; WHO COVID-19 Research Database; medRxiv) to identify all studies reporting primary data on COVID-19 related mortality and incidence of disease among LTC users and staff. We excluded studies not focusing on LTC. Included primary studies were critically appraised and results on number of deaths and COVID-19 related mortality rates, case fatality rates, and excess deaths (co-primary outcomes), as well as incidence of disease, hospitalisations, and ICU admissions were synthesised narratively. We further included official figures on number of deaths in LTC. Findings: A total of 30 study reports for 27 unique primary studies or outbreak reports were included. Outbreak investigations in LTC facilities found COVID-19 incidence rates of between 0.0% and 71.7% among residents and between 1.5% and 64.0% among staff. Mortality rates varied from 0.0% to 9.9% of all residents at outbreak facilities, with case fatality rates between 0.0% and 33.7%. In included studies, no LTC staff members had died. LTC residents accounted for between 0% (Hong Kong) and 82% (Canada) of COVID-related deaths, according to official figures. Interpretation: Long-term care users have been particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we found wide variation in spread of disease and mortality rates between outbreaks at individual LTC facilities. Further research into the factors determining successful prevention and containment of COVID-19 outbreaks is needed to protect long-term care users and staff.",
      "Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy for a pancreatic lymphoepithelial cyst: case report and review of literature. CONTEXT Lymphoepithelial cysts of the pancreas are a rare disease of true pancreatic cysts, the cause of which is unknown. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes many benign and malignant cystic lesions of the pancreas and surrounding organs. A combination of imaging modalities and fine needle aspiration might narrow the differential diagnosis. However, the final diagnosis can only be achieved with certainty after resection of the cyst. CASE REPORT The present case report is a lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas that was resected laparoscopically. A 53-year-old man was incidentally found to have a cystic tumor in the tail of the pancreas after undergoing an abdominal ultrasound, which showed a 41x33 mm cystic mass in the pancreatic tail. He had no abdominal symptoms. Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed. Histologic examination revealed a lymphoepithelial cyst. CONCLUSION Herein, we discuss the diagnostic difficulties and management decisions that face surgeons treating pancreatic cysts.",
      "Testing times in Coronavirus disease (Covid-19): A tale of two nations The Coronavirus Disease (Covid-19) pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 and was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease spread globally, leading to the World Health Organization declaring it a pandemic in March 2020. The condition is often fatal in its severe form. As it is a previously unknown virus, no treatment is identified or any vaccine available. The burden of disease control and containment, therefore, falls upon a robust and geographically appropriate testing strategy. Testing policies are modified, in turn, by the rapidly evolving patterns of the disease in various nations and by the evolving nature of tests in development. It is, therefore, helpful to study different national models to learn from the experience of different countries. This article compares testing strategies in the UK and India as the two countries travel different paths in controlling the pandemic. The UK is one of the most severely affected countries in the world. Initially restricted to hospitalised patients, the UK has broadened the scope of testing to many categories of individuals. In contrast, India appears to have a lower prevalence of the infection. However, the large Indian population and relatively insufficient testing capacities so far have led India to adopt a different testing trajectory, with the testing currently focused on high-risk groups in the community and hospitals. Owing to the rapidly changing nature of the disease, there can be no \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 policy but should be based on country-specific circumstances.",
      "Evaluation of a multiplex PCR assay for detection of respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in oropharyngeal swab samples from outpatients BACKGROUND: Respiratory viruses, such as influenza viruses, initially infect the upper airways but can manifest as severe lower respiratory tract infections in high\u2010risk patients with significant morbidity and mortality. For syndromic diagnosis, several multiplex nucleic acid amplification tests have been developed for clinics, of which SureX 13 Respiratory Pathogen Multiplex Kit (ResP) can simultaneously detect 13 pathogens directly from airway secretion specimens. The organisms identified are influenza virus A, influenza virus A pdmH1N1 (2009), influenza virus A H3N2, influenza virus B, adenovirus, boca virus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia. METHODS: This study provides performance evaluation data of this assay by comparing with pathogen\u2010specific PCRs from oropharyngeal swab samples. RESULTS: Ten pathogens were detected in this assay, of which rhinovirus, adenovirus, and influenza virus A pdmH1N1 (2009) were the most common. The overall agreement between the ResP and the comparator tests was 93.8%. The ResP demonstrated 86.5% agreement for positive results and 97.8% agreement for negative results. CONCLUSION: The ResP assay demonstrated a highly concordant performance comparing with pathogen\u2010specific PCRs for detection of respiratory pathogens in oropharyngeal swabs from outpatients and could aid in the diagnosis of respiratory infections in a variety of clinical scenarios."

      "Intra-aneurysmal hemodynamic alterations by a self-expandable intracranial stent and flow diversion stent: high intra-aneurysmal pressure remains regardless of flow velocity reduction. OBJECT Little is known about how much protection a flow diversion stent provides to a non-thrombosed aneurysm without the adjunctive use of coils. METHODS A three-dimensional anatomically realistic computation aneurysm model was created from the digital subtraction angiogram of a large internal carotid artery-ophthalmic artery aneurysm which could have been treated with either a neck bridging stent or a flow diversion stent. Three-dimensional computational models of the Neuroform EZ neck bridging stent and Pipeline embolization device were created based on measurements with a stereo-microscope. Each stent was placed in the computational aneurysm model and intra-aneurysmal flow structures were compared before and after placement of the stents. Computational fluid dynamics were performed by numerically solving the continuity and Navier-Stokes momentum equations for a steady blood flow based on the finite volume method. Blood was assumed as an incompressible Newtonian fluid. Vessel walls were assumed to be rigid, and no-slip boundary conditions were applied at the lumens. To estimate the change in the intra-aneurysmal pressures we assumed that, at the inlets, the intra-arterial pressure at peak systole was 120 mm Hg both before and after stent placement RESULTS Without any stent, the blood flow entered into the aneurysm dome from the mid to proximal neck area and ascended along the distal wall of the aneurysm. The flow then changed its direction anteriorly and moved along the proximal wall of the aneurysm dome. In addition to the primary intra-aneurysmal circulation pattern, a counterclockwise vortex was observed in the aneurysm dome. The placement of a Neuroform EZ stent induced a mean reduction in flow velocity of 14% and a small change in the overall intra-aneurysmal flow pattern. The placement of a Pipeline device induced a mean reduction in flow velocity of 74% and a significant change in flow pattern. Despite the flow velocity changes, Neuroform EZ and Pipeline devices induced reductions in intra-aneurysmal pressure of only 4 mm Hg and 8 mm Hg, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The flow diversion effects of both stents were limited to flow velocity reduction. In a non-thrombosed aneurysm or an aneurysm with delayed thrombosis, the intra-aneurysmal pressure remains essentially unchanged regardless of the level of the intra-aneurysmal flow velocity reduction induced by the stents.",
      "Racism and the Political Economy of COVID-19: Will We Continue to Resurrect the Past? COVID-19 is not spreading over a level playing field; structural racism is embedded within the fabric of American culture, infrastructure investments, and public policy, and fundamentally drives inequities. The same racism that has driven the systematic dismantling of the American social safety-net has also created the policy recipe for American structural vulnerability to the impacts of this and other pandemics. The Bronx provides an important case study for investigating the historical roots of structural inequities showcased by this pandemic; current lived experiences of Bronx residents are rooted in the racialized dismantling of New York City's public infrastructure and systematic disinvestment. The story of the Bronx is repeating itself, only this time with a novel virus. In order to address the root causes of inequities in cases and deaths due to COVID-19, we need to focus not just on restarting the economy, but on reimagining the economy, divesting of systems rooted in racism and the devaluation of Black and Brown lives.",
      "Identification of Vulnerable Populations and Areas at Higher Risk of COVID-19 Related Mortality in the U.S. Background The role of health-related disparities including sociodemographic, environmental, and critical care capacity in the COVID-19 pandemic are poorly understood. In the present study, we characterized vulnerable populations located in areas at higher risk of COVID-19 related mortality and low critical healthcare capacity in the U.S. Methods Using Bayesian multilevel analysis and small area disease risk mapping, we assessed the spatial variation of COVID-19 related mortality risk for the U.S. in relation with healthcare disparities including race, ethnicity, poverty, air quality, and critical healthcare capacity. Results Overall, highly populated, regional air hub areas, and minorities had an increased risk of COVID-19 related mortality. We found that with an increase of only 1 ug/m3 in long term PM2.5 exposure, the COVID-19 mortality rate increased by 13%. Counties with major air hubs had 18% increase in COVID-19 related death compared to counties with no airport connectivity. Sixty-eight percent of the counties with high COVID-19 related mortality risk were also counties with lower critical care capacity than national average. These counties were primary located at the North- and South-Eastern regions of the country. Conclusion The existing disparity in health and environmental risk factors that exacerbate the COVID-19 related mortality, along with the regional healthcare capacity, determine the vulnerability of populations to COVID-19 related mortality. The results from this study can be used to guide the development of strategies for the identification and targeting preventive strategies in vulnerable populations with a higher proportion of minority groups living in areas with poor air quality and low healthcare capacity.",
      "Americans\u2019 COVID-19 Stress, Coping, and Adherence to CDC Guidelines IMPORTANCE: Documenting Americans\u2019 stress responses to an unprecedented pandemic and their degree of adherence to CDC guidelines is essential for mental health interventions and policy-making. OBJECTIVE: To provide the first snapshot of immediate impact of COVID-19 on Americans\u2019 stress, coping, and guideline adherence. DESIGN: Data were collected from an online workers\u2019 platform for survey research (Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk) from April 7 to 9, 2020. The current data represents the baseline of a longitudinal study. Best practices for ensuring high-quality data were employed. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals who are 18 years of age or older, living in the USA, and English-speaking were eligible for the study. Of 1086 unique responses, 1015 completed responses are included. SETTING: Population-based. MAIN OUTCOMES: Exposure to and stressfulness of COVID-19 stressors, coping strategies, and adherence to CDC guidelines. RESULTS: The sample was 53.9% women (n = 547), with an average age of 38.9 years (SD = 13.50, range = 18\u201388), most of whom were White (n = 836, 82.4%), non-Hispanic (n = 929, 91.5%), and straight/heterosexual (n = 895, 88.2%); 40% were currently married (n = 407), and 21.6% (n = 219) were caregivers. About half (50.5%) endorsed having at least \u201cmostly\u201d enough money to meet their needs. Respondents\u2019 locations across the USA ranged from 18.5% in the Northeast to 37.8% in the South. The most commonly experienced stressors were reading/hearing about the severity and contagiousness of COVID-19, uncertainty about length of quarantine and social distancing requirements, and changes to social and daily personal care routines. Financial concerns were rated most stressful. Younger age, female gender, and caregiver status increased risk for stressor exposure and greater degree of stressfulness. The most frequently reported strategies to manage stress were distraction, active coping, and seeking emotional social support. CDC guideline adherence was generally high, but several key social distancing and hygiene behaviors showed suboptimal adherence, particularly for men and younger adults. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Americans have high COVID-19 stress exposure and some demographic subgroups appear particularly vulnerable to stress effects. Subgroups less likely to adhere to CDC guidelines may benefit from targeted information campaigns. these findings may guide mental health interventions and inform policy-making regarding implications of specific public health measures.",
      "Fair Packing of Independent Sets In this work we add a graph theoretical perspective to a classical problem of fairly allocating indivisible items to several agents. Agents have different profit valuations of items and we allow an incompatibility relation between pairs of items described in terms of a conflict graph. Hence, every feasible allocation of items to the agents corresponds to a partial coloring, that is, a collection of pairwise disjoint independent sets. The sum of profits of vertices/items assigned to one color/agent should be optimized in a maxi-min sense. We derive complexity and algorithmic results for this problem, which is a generalization of the classical Partition and Independent Set problems. In particular, we show that the problem is strongly NP-complete in the classes of bipartite graphs and their line graphs, and solvable in pseudo-polynomial time in the classes of cocomparability graphs and biconvex bipartite graphs.",
      "COVID-19 and the US response: accelerating health inequities Health inequities have long defined health and the healthcare system in the USA. The clinical and research capacity across the USA is unparalleled, yet compared to other high and even some middle-income countries, the average health indicators of the population remain suboptimal in 2020, a finding at least in part explained by inequity in healthcare access. In this context, COVID-19 has rapidly emerged as a major threat to the public\u2019s health. While it was initially thought that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 would be the great equaliser as it would not discriminate, it is clear that COVID-19 incidence and mortality have rapidly reinforced health disparities drawn by historical and contemporary inequities. Here, we synthesise the data highlighting specific risks among particular marginalised and under-resourced communities including those in jails, prisons and detention centers, immigrants and the undocumented, people with disabilities and people experiencing homelessness across the USA. The drivers of these disparities are pervasive structural risks including limited access to preventive services, inability to comply with physical distancing recommendations, underlying health disparities and intersecting stigmas particularly affecting racial and ethnic minorities across the country, including African Americans, Latinx Americans and Native Americans. Advancing the COVID-19 response, saving lives and restarting the economy necessitate rapidly addressing these inequities rather than ignoring and even reinforcing them.",
      "SARS-CoV-2 infection of primary human lung epithelium for COVID-19 modeling and drug discovery Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the latest respiratory pandemic resulting from zoonotic transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Severe symptoms include viral pneumonia secondary to infection and inflammation of the lower respiratory tract, in some cases causing death. We developed primary human lung epithelial infection models to understand responses of proximal and distal lung epithelium to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Differentiated air-liquid interface cultures of proximal airway epithelium and 3D organoid cultures of alveolar epithelium were readily infected by SARS-CoV-2 leading to an epithelial cell-autonomous proinflammatory response. We validated the efficacy of selected candidate COVID-19 drugs confirming that Remdesivir strongly suppressed viral infection/replication. We provide a relevant platform for studying COVID-19 pathobiology and for rapid drug screening against SARS-CoV-2 and future emergent respiratory pathogens.",
      "Role of a habitat's air humidity in Covid-19 mortality Abstract Transient local over-dry environment might be a contributor and an explanation for the observed asynchronous local rises in Covid-19 mortality. We propose that a habitat's air humidity negatively correlate with Covid-19 morbidity and mortality, and support this hypothesis on the example of publicly available data from German federal states.",
      "Distinct Roles for Sialoside and Protein Receptors in Coronavirus Infection Coronaviruses (CoVs) are common human and animal pathogens that can transmit zoonotically and cause severe respiratory disease syndromes. CoV infection requires spike proteins, which bind viruses to host cell receptors and catalyze virus-cell membrane fusion. Several CoV strains have spike proteins with two receptor-binding domains, an S1A that engages host sialic acids and an S1B that recognizes host transmembrane proteins. As this bivalent binding may enable broad zoonotic CoV infection, we aimed to identify roles for each receptor in distinct infection stages. Focusing on two betacoronaviruses, murine JHM-CoV and human Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), we found that virus particle binding to cells was mediated by sialic acids; however, the transmembrane protein receptors were required for a subsequent virus infection. These results favored a two-step process in which viruses first adhere to sialic acids and then require subsequent engagement with protein receptors during infectious cell entry. However, sialic acids sufficiently facilitated the later stages of virus spread through cell-cell membrane fusion, without requiring protein receptors. This virus spread in the absence of the prototype protein receptors was increased by adaptive S1A mutations. Overall, these findings reveal roles for sialic acids in virus-cell binding, viral spike protein-directed cell-cell fusion, and resultant spread of CoV infections.IMPORTANCE CoVs can transmit from animals to humans to cause serious disease. This zoonotic transmission uses spike proteins, which bind CoVs to cells with two receptor-binding domains. Here, we identified the roles for the two binding processes in the CoV infection process. Binding to sialic acids promoted infection and also supported the intercellular expansion of CoV infections through syncytial development. Adaptive mutations in the sialic acid-binding spike domains increased the intercellular expansion process. These findings raise the possibility that the lectin-like properties of many CoVs contribute to facile zoonotic transmission and intercellular spread within infected organisms.",
      "Disparities in Coronavirus 2019 Reported Incidence, Knowledge, and Behavior Among US Adults Importance: Data from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the US show large differences in hospitalizations and mortality across race and geography. However, there are limited data on health information, beliefs, and behaviors that might indicate different exposure to risk. Objective: To determine the association of sociodemographic characteristics with reported incidence, knowledge, and behavior regarding COVID-19 among US adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: A US national survey study was conducted from March 29 to April 13, 2020, to measure differences in knowledge, beliefs, and behavior about COVID-19. The survey oversampled COVID-19 hotspot areas. The survey was conducted electronically. The criteria for inclusion were age 18 years or older and residence in the US. Data analysis was performed in April 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were incidence, knowledge, and behaviors related to COVID-19 as measured by survey response. Results: The survey included 5198 individuals (mean [SD] age, 48 [18] years; 2336 men [45%]; 3759 white [72%], 830 [16%] African American, and 609 [12%] Hispanic). The largest differences in COVID-19-related knowledge and behaviors were associated with race/ethnicity, sex, and age, with African American participants, men, and people younger than 55 years showing less knowledge than other groups. African American respondents were 3.5 percentage points (95% CI, 1.5 to 5.5 percentage points; P = .001) more likely than white respondents to report being infected with COVID-19, as were men compared with women (3.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.0 to 4.4 percentage points; P < .001). Knowing someone who tested positive for COVID-19 was more common among African American respondents (7.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 3.4 to 10.9 percentage points; P < .001), people younger than 30 years (11.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 7.5 to 15.7 percentage points; P < .001), and people with higher incomes (coefficient on earning &#8805;$100\u00e2\u0080\u00af000, 12.3 percentage points; 95% CI, 8.7 to 15.8 percentage points; P < .001). Knowledge of potential fomite spread was lower among African American respondents (-9.4 percentage points; 95% CI, -13.1 to -5.7 percentage points; P < .001), Hispanic respondents (-4.8 percentage points; 95% CI, -8.9 to -0.77 percentage points; P = .02), and people younger than 30 years (-10.3 percentage points; 95% CI, -14.1 to -6.5 percentage points; P < .001). Similar gaps were found with respect to knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms and preventive behaviors. Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey study of US adults, there were gaps in reported incidence of COVID-19 and knowledge regarding its spread and symptoms and social distancing behavior. More effort is needed to increase accurate information and encourage appropriate behaviors among minority communities, men, and younger people."
