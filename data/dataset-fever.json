      "Fringe is an American science fiction television series created by J. J. Abrams , Alex Kurtzman , and Roberto Orci . It premiered on the Fox Broadcasting network on September 9 , 2008 , and concluded on January 18 , 2013 , after five seasons and 100 episodes . The series follows Olivia Dunham ( Anna Torv ) , Peter Bishop ( Joshua Jackson ) , and Walter Bishop ( John Noble ) , all members of the fictional Fringe Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , based in Boston , Massachusetts , under the supervision of Homeland Security . The team uses fringe science and FBI investigative techniques to investigate a series of unexplained , often ghastly occurrences , which are related to mysteries surrounding a parallel universe .   The series has been described as a hybrid of fantasy and procedural dramas and serials , influenced by film and television shows such as Lost , The X-Files , Altered States , and The Twilight Zone . The series began as a traditional mystery-of-the-week series and became more serialized in later seasons . Most episodes contain a standalone plot , with several others also exploring the series ' overarching mythology .   Critical reception was at first lukewarm but became more favorable after the first season , when the series began to explore its mythology , including parallel universes and alternate timelines . The show , as well as the cast and crew , were nominated for many major awards . Despite its move to the `` Friday night death slot '' and low ratings , the series developed a cult following . It also spawned two six-part comic book series , an alternate reality game , and three novels .",

      "The Purgi language ( alternative spellings : Purki , Purig , Purik and Burig ) is spoken by the Purikpa , a group of Tibetan Muslims , with a slight mixture with Dardic . The Purikpa live south of the Balti in Ladakh .   Most of them live in Ladakh and Baltistan , especially in Kargil although significant numbers reside in Leh . Many Puriks are also present in China .   Because they inhabit the higher reaches of the arid Himalayas , they depend on glacial runoff for irrigation of their crops . Barley , wheat and millet are grown where water is sufficient , especially along small rivers . The hot summer temperatures also allow for a wide variety of fruits to be raised .   Unlike the Dards and the Shina , the Purikpa are not nomads . They transfer their livestock from one grazing ground to another upon the arrival of autumn . During the summer months , they drive the cattle to alpine pastures . All households own at least one female dzo , which is a cross between a cow and a yak . That animal produces milk .   Most of them are Shia Muslims by religion although significant Sunni Muslims and a small minority of Buddhists and B\u00f6n followers reside in isolated areas .

      "Ecological genetics is the study of genetics in natural populations .   This contrasts with classical genetics , which works mostly on crosses between laboratory strains , and DNA sequence analysis , which studies genes at the molecular level .   Research in this field is on traits of ecological significance -- that is , traits related to fitness , which affect an organism 's survival and reproduction . Examples might be : flowering time , drought tolerance , polymorphism , mimicry , avoidance of attacks by predators .   Research usually involves a mixture of field and laboratory studies . Samples of natural populations may be taken back to the laboratory for their genetic variation to be analysed . Changes in the populations at different times and places will be noted , and the pattern of mortality in these populations will be studied . Research is often done on insects and other organisms that have short generation times .",

      "The South Island or Te Waipounamu ( M\u0101ori ) is the larger of the two major islands of New Zealand , the other being the smaller but more populous North Island . It is bordered to the north by Cook Strait , to the west by the Tasman Sea , and to the south and east by the Pacific Ocean . The South Island covers 150437 km2 and has a temperate climate .

      "Boethus of Sidon ( \u0392\u03cc\u03b7\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 c. 75 -- c. 10 BC ) was a Peripatetic philosopher from Sidon , who lived towards the end of the 1st century BC .   As he was a disciple of Andronicus of Rhodes , he must have travelled at an early age to Rome and Athens , in which cities Andronicus is known to have taught . Strabo , who mentions him and his brother Diodotus among the celebrated persons of Sidon , speaks of him at the same time as his own teacher ( or fellow pupil ) in Peripatetic philosophy . Among his works , all of which are now lost , there was one on the nature of the soul , and also a commentary on Aristotle 's Categories , which is mentioned by Ammonius in his commentary on the same work of Aristotle . Ammonius quotes also an opinion of Boethus concerning the study of the works of Aristotle , viz . that the student should begin with the Physics , whereas Andronicus had maintained that the beginning should be made with the Logic writings of Aristotle .   According to Giovanni Reale , in The Schools of the Imperial Age , ( pp. 18 -- 19 ) , Boethos believed that ` substance ' was ` matter ' -- that it was the composite of being , and not the individual form of being . Thus `` form falls outside of the category of substance and enters into the scope of other categories '' . The significance of this is that individuality is not only how we understand and interpret reality , but is actually the basic nature of that reality . That ` true reality ' was not some universal substance , but consisted of individual forms .   Similarly , in ethics , he declared that `` the original goal ( the proton oikeion ) towards which we tend is ourselves in relation to ourselves . In agreement with that view , he says that we do not love anyone in preference to ourselves and finally that we only love others in reference to ourselves '' ."

      "Thomas Russell Williams ( 1869 -- 1926 ) was a British socialist politician .   Williams grew up in Huddersfield and largely educated himself . He entered the textile industry and rose to become manager of a mill . He tried to enter the civil service , but was rejected , and instead turned his attention to the trade union movement . He became interested in ethical socialism and joined the Independent Labour Party ( ILP ) , serving on its national council , though never becoming a figure well-known to the public .   Williams stood as the Labour Representation Committee candidate for Huddersfield at the 1906 general election . He was initially selected by the local trades council , and only later gained the backing of the ILP , against the private wishes of Ramsay MacDonald . He believed that he had a strong chance of winning the seat , but ultimately took a close second place , with 35.2 % of the vote , on an extremely high turnout of 94 % of eligible voters .   Williams stood again at the Huddersfield by-election , 1906 , for the renamed Labour Party , but again lost narrowly , his vote dropping slightly to 33.8 % . Although blaming this on the disqualification of some working class voters , he also admitted that the party had failed to make new converts .   Williams lost further favour with the ILP leadership after he endorsed Victor Grayson in his successful independent labour campaign at the Colne Valley by-election , 1907 . However , he was selected for Spen Valley , taking 23.3 % of the vote at the January 1910 general election . In anticipation of an election in 1914 or 1915 , he was made Labour 's Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Darlington , but was not happy as he felt there was little chance of winning the seat , and by the time the 1918 general election came around , there was no Labour candidate in the town .   Williams died in 1926 .",
      "Damper is a traditional Australian soda bread , historically prepared by swagmen , drovers , stockmen and other travellers . It consists of a wheat flour based bread , traditionally baked in the coals of a campfire or in a in a camp oven . Damper is an iconic Australian dish . It is also made in camping situations in New Zealand , and has been for many decades .   Damper was originally developed by stockmen who travelled in remote areas for long periods , with only basic rations of flour , sugar and tea , supplemented by whatever meat was available . The basic ingredients of damper were flour , water , and sometimes milk . Baking soda could be used for leavening . The damper was normally cooked in the ashes of the camp fire . The ashes were flattened , and the damper was cooked there for ten minutes . Following this , the damper was covered with ashes and cooked for another 20 to 30 minutes until the damper sounded hollow when tapped . Alternatively , the damper was cooked in a greased camp oven . Damper was eaten with dried or cooked meat or golden syrup , also known as `` cocky 's joy '' .   Damper is also a popular dish with Indigenous Australians . Aboriginal women had traditionally made bush bread from seasonal grains and nuts . Today , a variety of different recipes for damper are available online .",

      "The Raven is a 2012 American psychological thriller drama film directed by James McTeigue , produced by Marc D. Evans , Trevor Macy and Aaron Ryder and written by Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare . It stars John Cusack , Alice Eve , Brendan Gleeson and Luke Evans .   Set in 1849 , it is a fictionalized account of the last days of Edgar Allan Poe 's life , in which the poet and author pursues a serial killer whose murders mirror those in Poe 's stories . While the plot of the film is fictional , the writers based it on some accounts of real situations surrounding Edgar Allan Poe 's mysterious death . Poe is said to have repeatedly called out the name `` Reynolds '' on the night before his death , though it is unclear to whom he was referring . The title derives from Poe 's poem `` The Raven '' , in the similar manner of the earlier unrelated 1935 and 1963 films .   It was released in Canada , Ireland , and the United Kingdom on March 9 , 2012 and in the United States on April 27 , 2012 . It was a moderate commercial success , receiving $ 1.7 million more than its budget , but garnering near-negative reviews , with the visual effects and score by Lucas Vidal praised , but the performances and plot twists criticized .",

Multicellular organisms arise in various different ways , for example by cell division or by aggregation of many single cells . Colonial organisms are the result of many identical individuals joining together to form a colony . However , it can often be hard to separate colonial protists from true multicellular organisms , because the two concepts are not distinct ; colonial protists have been dubbed `` pluricellular '' rather than `` multicellular '' ."

      "`` The Berlin key or how to do words with things '' was written by sociologist Bruno Latour , and it originally appeared as La clef de Berlin et autres lecons d'un amateur de sciences , La D\u00e8couverte , in 1993 . `` The Berlin key or how to do words with things '' was later published as the first chapter in P.M. Graves-Brown 's Matter , Materiality and Modern Culture . Within the 15-page chapter , written informally in third-person narrative , Latour deftly exposes how many layers a unique key can connote . In the P.M. Graves-Brown version , Lydia Davis translated the piece into English . Additional editing was completed and illustrations redrawn by PMGB . The title could have been chosen as a witty word-play off of J.L. Austin 's How to Do Things With Words .   Latour argues that while an object 's purposefully designed material nature may recommend or permit a highly controlled set of functional purposes , it may also offer a broad range of valuable possibilities .   Latour uses the Berlin key to show that there are social constraints which force people to do whatever it is that the object makes them do ; thus , the object ( the Berlin key ) is a sign , of sorts , telling the inhabitants to ` lock their doors at night , but never during the day . '   Latour discusses the relationship between the social realm and the technological realm . He asserts that the Sociologist and the Technologist are `` enemy brothers '' , thinking they will come to an end -- the sociologist with the social and the technologist with objects .",

With an area of approximately 44 hectares ( 110 acres ) , and a population of 1,000 , it is the smallest state in the world by both area and population . However , formally it is not sovereign , with sovereignty being held by the Holy See , the only entity of public international law that has diplomatic relations with almost every country in the world .   It is an ecclesiastical or sacerdotal-monarchical state ( a type of theocracy ) ruled by the Bishop of Rome -- the Pope . The highest state functionaries are all Catholic clergy of various national origins . Since the return of the Popes from Avignon in 1377 , they have generally resided at the Apostolic Palace within what is now Vatican City , although at times residing instead in the Quirinal Palace in Rome or elsewhere .   Vatican City is distinct from the Holy See ( -LSB- Sancta Sedes , links = no -RSB- ) , which dates back to early Christianity and is the main episcopal see of 1.2 billion Latin and Eastern Catholic adherents around the globe . The independent city-state , on the other hand , came into existence in 1929 by the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and Italy , which spoke of it as a new creation , not as a vestige of the much larger Papal States ( 756 -- 1870 ) , which had previously encompassed much of central Italy . According to the terms of the treaty , the Holy See has `` full ownership , exclusive dominion , and sovereign authority and jurisdiction '' over the city-state .   Within Vatican City are religious and cultural sites such as St. Peter 's Basilica , the Sistine Chapel and the Vatican Museums . They feature some of the world 's most famous paintings and sculptures . The unique economy of Vatican City is supported financially by the sale of postage stamps and tourist mementos , fees for admission to museums , and the sale of publications ."

Though Highsmith had many sexual and romantic relationships with women and wrote over 22 novels and numerous short stories , The Price of Salt is her only novel about an unequivocal lesbian relationship and its relatively happy ending was unprecedented in lesbian literature .

Widely considered to be one of the greatest boxers of all time , undefeated as a professional , and a five-division world champion , Mayweather won fifteen world titles and the lineal championship in four different weight classes ( twice at welterweight ) . As an amateur , he won a bronze medal in the featherweight division at the 1996 Olympics .

In the same year , he peaked as BoxRec 's number one fighter of all time , pound for pound , as well as the greatest welterweight of all time . Many sporting news and boxing websites ranked Mayweather as the best boxer in the world , pound for pound , twice in a span of ten years ; including The Ring , Sports Illustrated , ESPN , BoxRec , Fox Sports , and Yahoo!

      "The second USS Worcester ( CL-144 ) was laid down on 29 January 1945 at Camden , New Jersey , by the New York Shipbuilding and Drydock Corp. ; launched on 4 February 1947 ; sponsored by Gloria Ann Sullivan , the daughter of Mayor F. G. Sullivan of Worcester , Massachusetts ; and commissioned at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 26 June 1948 , Capt. T. B. Dugan in command .   Combining destroyer maneuverability with cruiser size and given a main battery that could deal not only with surface targets but with aircraft as well , Worcester embodied many of the lessons learned during World War II ; she and her sister ship Roanoke epitomized the hard-hitting dual-purpose cruiser . However the design is largely considered a failure , as the main armament of twin automatic 6 in guns never achieved fire rates of more 9-10 rpm which was lower than the similar design of automatic 8 in guns on the USS Newport News . Also the fire control fitted to the Worcester was optimised for anti aircraft fire rather than surface action or GFS and the Royal Navy 6 inch gun cruisers HMS Belfast and HMS Jamaica actually performed much better in GFS in the Korean War , the HMS Belfast 's firepower being very useful in the Inchon landing and the US Navy view being central to the British decision to refit the Belfast in 1955 . Worcester and Roanoke seemed to offer little more than the post - war group 3 Juneau-class light cruisers on 40 % of the displacement , the USS Juneau ( CL-119 ) as refitted in in 1951 with 6 twin Mk 38 5 in guns and 12 50 calibre 3 in guns on 6000 ton displacement seeming a better answer .

      "Richard Laming ( c. 1798 -- 3 May 1879 ) was a British surgeon , natural philosopher , inventor , chemist and industrialist .   There is some uncertainty about his origins . It is believed that he was born in Margate , England on 17 August 1799 , the son of James Laming , a packet owner , and Sarah Walton . He had an elder brother James , born 1791 , who was a prosperous merchant . In 1825 , Richard qualified for membership of the Royal College of Surgeons , and he established a practice in London .   During his leisure moments , Richard developed an interest in the theory of electricity . Between 1838 and 1851 he published a series of papers speculating about the electrical makeup of atoms . He hypothesized that there existed sub-atomic particles of unit charge ; one of the first persons ever to do so . He suggested that the atom was made up of a core of material surrounded by concentric shells of these electrical ` atoms ' , or particles . He also believed that these particles could be added or subtracted to an atom , changing its charge .   Around 1844 , he suggested a mechanism for an insulator as an atom surrounded by a `` perfect external spherical strata '' of electrical particles . He also supposed that chemical reactions could occur when two atoms share an electrical charge . However , perhaps because he provided no experimental backing for his ideas , he received little interest from the Royal Society .   In 1838 he moved to Paris , where he remained for about a decade . There his ideas also received little interest and he was regarded as eccentric . His medical practice apparently ended some time around 1842 . When he returned to England his interests leaned toward chemistry , and began working in the coal-gas industry .   He applied for several patents :  1844 , for improvements in the purification and application of ammonia .  1847 , for a continuous recuperator made of iron tubes , which may be the oldest such device known .  1850 , for improvements in the manufacture of gas for illumination and other purposes to which coal gas is applicable .  1850 , for the Laming process , which was a method of removing hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide from coal gas .  1861 , Improvements in manufacturing alkaline carbonates .   During the 1860s , he apparently became interested in the telegraph and he applied for two patents for improvements to the device . He retired around 1865 to live along the south coast of England . He died on 3 May 1879 in Arundel , Sussex . He was twice married and had at least two sons .",

      "Kopala is a traditional hero or demigod revered in the highlands of Pshavi in Georgia . It is said that he once was in a boulder-throwing contest against a number of devebi , or ogres , to see who could throw a boulder the farthest . The ogres ' champion picked up a boulder and hurled it across the valley to the mountain on the other side of the Aragvi river . K'op ` ala tested a boulder , but decided it was too light . So he picked up another boulder , pressed it against the first , and threw them both across the valley . These nearly failed to surpass the ogre 's throw , but at the crucial moment the god K'viria struck the boulder with his whip , causing it to fly further than the ogre 's boulder , and it landed on top of the ogres ' fortress of Tsikhetgori . As a result of their defeat in an ensuing battle which K'op ` ala fought with his companion Iakhsari , the surviving ogres retreated underground allowing mankind to settle in the area unmolested .",

      "Anomotaenia brevis is a tapeworm which has been found to be one of many parasite species able to manipulate their host 's behavior . Host manipulation is commonly observed in parasites with complex life cycles reliant on multiple hosts for development . While the definitive host for A. brevis is the woodpecker , their intermediate host is the Temnothorax nylanderi , a species of ant located in the oak forests of western Europe . The tapeworm alters the appearance and behavior of the T. nylanderi ant in order to ensure transmission to the woodpecker , where it can complete its life cycle .   The tapeworm affects the behavior , life history , and morphology of the T. nylanderi ant , as well as indirectly affects its uninfected nest-mates . The ant larva is infected after feeding on bird faeces contaminated with A. brevis eggs . The tapeworm penetrates the ant 's gut wall and develops into a cysticercoid within the haemocoel . As the parasitic tapeworm larvae develops in the ant 's body , the ant begins to change . They smell different from and are smaller than their nest-mates , their cuticles turn yellow instead of the usual brown color , and they tend to stay sitting in the nest . They also have a higher survival rate compared to their uninfected nest-mates , which allows the parasite to have a higher chance at reaching the definitive host .",

      "A near-Earth object ( NEO ) is any small Solar System body whose orbit brings it into proximity with Earth . By definition , a solar system body is a NEO if its closest approach to the Sun ( perihelion ) is less than 1.3 astronomical unit ( AU ) . NEOs include more than fourteen thousand near-Earth asteroids ( NEAs ) , more than one hundred near-Earth comets ( NECs ) , and a number of solar-orbiting spacecraft and meteoroids , large enough to be tracked in space before striking the Earth . It is now widely accepted that collisions in the past have had a significant role in shaping the geological and biological history of the Earth . NEOs have become of increased interest since the 1980s because of increased awareness of the potential danger some of the asteroids or comets pose , and mitigations are being researched . In January 2016 , NASA announced the Planetary Defense Coordination Office to track NEOs larger than 30 to 50 meters in diameter and coordinate an effective threat response and mitigation effort .   NEAs have orbits that lie partly between 0.983 and 1.3 AU away from the Sun . When a NEA is detected it is submitted to the IAU 's Minor Planet Center for cataloging . Some NEAs orbits intersect that of Earth 's so they pose a collision danger . The United States , European Union , and other nations are currently scanning for NEOs in an effort called Spaceguard .   In the United States and since 1998 , NASA has a congressional mandate to catalogue all NEOs that are at least 1 kilometer wide , as the impact of such an object would be globally catastrophic . In 2006 , it was estimated that 20 % of the mandated objects had not yet been found . In 2011 , largely as a result of NEOWISE , it was estimated that 93 % of the NEAs larger than 1 km had been found and that only about 70 remained to be discovered . , there have been 875 NEAs larger than 1 km discovered , of which 157 are potentially hazardous . The inventory is much less complete for smaller objects , which still have potential for large scale , though not global , damage .   Potentially hazardous objects ( PHOs ) are currently defined based on parameters that measure the object 's potential to make threatening close approaches to the Earth . Mostly objects with an Earth minimum orbit intersection distance ( MOID ) of 0.05 AU or less and an absolute magnitude ( H ) of 22.0 or brighter ( a rough indicator of large size ) are considered PHOs . Objects that can not approach closer to the Earth ( i.e. MOID ) than 0.05 AU , or are smaller than about 150 m ( 500 ft ) in diameter ( i.e. H = 22.0 with assumed albedo of 13 % ) , are not considered PHOs . NASA 's catalog for near-Earth objects also includes the approach distances of asteroids and comets measured in lunar distances , and this usage has become a common unit of measure used by the news media in discussing these objects .   Some NEOs are of special interest because they can be physically explored with lower mission velocity than for even the Moon , due to their combination of low velocity with respect to Earth ( \u0394V ) and weak gravity , so they may present interesting scientific opportunities both for direct geochemical and astronomical investigation , and as potentially economical sources of extraterrestrial materials for human exploitation . This makes them an attractive target for exploration . As of 2016 , three near-Earth objects have been visited by spacecraft .",

      "The Sch\u00f6nhage -- Strassen algorithm is an asymptotically fast multiplication algorithm for large integers . It was developed by Arnold Sch\u00f6nhage and Volker Strassen in 1971 . The run-time bit complexity is , in Big O notation , for two n-digit numbers . The algorithm uses recursive Fast Fourier transforms in rings with 2n +1 elements , a specific type of number theoretic transform .   The Sch\u00f6nhage -- Strassen algorithm was the asymptotically fastest multiplication method known from 1971 until 2007 , when a new method , F\u00fcrer 's algorithm , was announced with lower asymptotic complexity ; however , F\u00fcrer 's algorithm currently only achieves an advantage for astronomically large values and is not used in practice .   In practice the Sch\u00f6nhage -- Strassen algorithm starts to outperform older methods such as Karatsuba and Toom -- Cook multiplication for numbers beyond 2215 to 2217 ( 10,000 to 40,000 decimal digits ) . The GNU Multi-Precision Library uses it for values of at least 1728 to 7808 64-bit words ( 33,000 to 150,000 decimal digits ) , depending on architecture . There is a Java implementation of Sch\u00f6nhage -- Strassen which uses it above 74,000 decimal digits .   Applications of the Sch\u00f6nhage -- Strassen algorithm include mathematical empiricism , such as the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search and computing approximations of \u03c0 , as well as practical applications such as Kronecker substitution , in which multiplication of polynomials with integer coefficients can be efficiently reduced to large integer multiplication ; this is used in practice by GMP-ECM for Lenstra elliptic curve factorization .",
      "The Conference on Disarmament ( CD ) is a forum established by the international community to negotiate multilateral arms control and disarmament agreements . Established in 1979 , it was the forum used by its member states , currently numbering 65 , to negotiate the Biological Weapons Convention and the Chemical Weapons Convention .   While the conference is not formally a United Nations ( UN ) organization , it is linked to the UN through a personal representative of the United Nations Secretary-General ; this representative serves as the secretary general of the conference . Resolutions adopted by the UN General Assembly often request the conference to consider specific disarmament matters . In turn , the conference annually reports its activities to the Assembly .   The Conference succeeded the Ten-Nation Committee on Disarmament ( 1960 ) , the Eighteen-Nation Committee on Disarmament ( 1962 -- 68 ) and the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament ( 1969 -- 78 ) .   In the 1990s , the Conference held intensive efforts over three years to draft the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty text and its two annexes , but it did not succeed in reaching consensus on the adoption of the text . Australia then sent the text to the United Nations General Assembly in New York City , where it was submitted as a draft resolution . On 10 September 1996 , the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) was adopted by a large majority , exceeding two-thirds of the General Assembly 's Membership .   Currently under discussion are a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty ( FMCT ) , a pact to prevent an arms race in outer space ( PAROS ) , nuclear disarmament , and negative security assurances ( NSA ) .   On June 28 , 2011 , the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea ( North Korea ) was appointed to serve a term as president of the Conference .  Despite the fact that the chairmanship rotates alphabetically , the move was criticized in the media and by Canada 's foreign minister because of the country 's track record on nuclear proliferation .   From May 27 to June 23 , 2013 , the Islamic Republic of Iran was acting chair and president of the Conference on Disarmament .

      "Underseal ( often called undercoating in the U.S. ) is a thick resilient coating applied to the underbody or chassis of an automobile to protect against impact damage from small stones , which would rapidly chip ordinary paint , allowing rusting to begin .   Historically a bitumen-based compound was used , but after approximately a decade this becomes brittle and water can become trapped between the underseal and body metal , ironically creating a more favourable environment for rust than if no underseal was applied at all . Wax-based underseals do not have this disadvantage but can be eroded and eventually washed off by enthusiastic use of a hot pressure washer . Rubber-based underseals are also sometimes used .   Vehicles for sale in some territories are not undersealed , because the climate is not sufficiently aggressive to warrant it . If such a vehicle is subsequently imported into a country with high rainfall , cold winters and where salting of the roads is common , application of underseal is strongly recommended to ensure the vehicle has a long life .   When concrete on streets , parking lots , or warehouse floors begins to degrade , there are a few methods of repair available . Concrete undersealing is a process by which hot asphalt is pumped underneath the concrete slab so it flows into patches that were hollow and eroded . After concrete undersealing , the concrete is more stable and can be overlaid with a thin layer of asphalt to repair cracks , saving the expense and time of replacing the entire surface .

      "The Selma to Montgomery marches were three protest marches , held in 1965 , along the 54-mile ( 87 km ) highway from Selma , Alabama to the state capital of Montgomery . The marches were organized by nonviolent activists to demonstrate the desire of African-American citizens to exercise their constitutional right to vote , in defiance of segregationist repression , and were part of a broader voting rights movement underway in Selma and throughout the American South . By highlighting racial injustice , they contributed to passage that year of the Voting Rights Act , a landmark federal achievement of the Civil Rights Movement .   Southern state legislatures had passed and maintained a series of discriminatory requirements and practices that had disenfranchised most of the millions of African Americans across the South throughout the 20th century . The African-American group known as the Dallas County Voters League ( DCVL ) launched a voters registration campaign in Selma in 1963 . Joined by organizers from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee ( SNCC ) , they began working that year in a renewed effort to register black voters .   Finding resistance by white officials to be intractable , even after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ended legal segregation , the DCVL invited Rev. Martin Luther King , Jr. and the activists of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference ( SCLC ) to join them . SCLC brought many prominent civil rights and civic leaders to Selma in January 1965 . Local and regional protests began , with 3,000 people arrested by the end of February . According to Joseph A. Califano Jr. , who served as head of domestic affairs for U.S. President Lyndon Johnson between the years 1965 and 1969 , the President viewed King as an essential partner in getting the Voting Rights Act enacted . Califano , whom the President also assigned to monitor the final march to Montgomery , noted that Johnson and King talked by telephone on January 15 to plan a strategy for drawing attention to the injustice of using literacy tests and other barriers to stop black Southerners from voting and that King later informed the President on February 9 of his decision to use Selma to achieve this objective .   On February 26 , 1965 , activist and deacon Jimmie Lee Jackson died after being mortally shot several days earlier by a state trooper , James Bonard Fowler , during a peaceful march in nearby Marion , Alabama . To defuse and refocus the community 's outrage , SCLC Director of Direct Action James Bevel , who was directing SCLC 's Selma voting rights movement , called for a march of dramatic length , from Selma to the state capital of Montgomery . Bevel had been working on his Alabama Project for voting rights since late 1963 .   The first march took place on March 7 , 1965 , organized locally by Bevel , Amelia Boynton , and others . State troopers and county possemen attacked the unarmed marchers with billy clubs and tear gas after they passed over the county line , and the event became known as Bloody Sunday . Law enforcement beat Boynton unconscious , and the media publicized worldwide a picture of her lying wounded on the Edmund Pettus Bridge .   The second march took place March 10 . Troopers , police , and marchers confronted each other at the county end of the bridge , but when the troopers stepped aside to let them pass , King led the marchers back to the church . He was obeying a federal injunction while seeking protection from federal court for the march . That night , a white group beat and murdered civil rights activist James Reeb , a Unitarian Universalist minister from Boston , who had come to Selma to march with the second group . Many other clergy and sympathizers from across the country also gathered for the second march .   The violence of the `` Bloody Sunday '' and of Reeb 's death led to a national outcry and some acts of civil disobedience , targeting both the Alabama and federal governments . The protesters demanded protection for the Selma marchers and a new federal voting rights law to enable African Americans to register and vote without harassment . President Lyndon Johnson , whose administration had been working on a voting rights law , held a historic , nationally televised joint session of Congress on March 15 to ask for the bill 's introduction and passage .   With Governor Wallace refusing to protect the marchers , President Johnson committed to do so . The third march started March 21 . Protected by 1,900 members of the Alabama National Guard under federal command , and many FBI agents and Federal Marshals , the marchers averaged 10 miles ( 16 km ) a day along U.S. Route 80 , known in Alabama as the `` Jefferson Davis Highway '' . The marchers arrived in Montgomery on March 24 and at the Alabama State Capitol on March 25 . With thousands having joined the campaign , 25,000 people entered the capital city that day in support of voting rights .   The route is memorialized as the `` Selma To Montgomery Voting Rights Trail , '' and is designated as a U.S. National Historic Trail .",

      "Dark matter is a hypothetical type of matter distinct from baryonic matter ( ordinary matter such as protons and neutrons ) , neutrinos and dark energy . The existence of dark matter would explain a number of otherwise puzzling astronomical observations . The name refers to the fact that it does not emit or interact with electromagnetic radiation , such as light , and is thus invisible to the entire electromagnetic spectrum . Although dark matter has not been directly observed , its existence and properties are inferred from its gravitational effects such as the motions of visible matter , gravitational lensing , its influence on the universe 's large-scale structure , on galaxies , and its effects in the cosmic microwave background .   The standard model of cosmology indicates that the total mass -- energy of the universe contains 4.9 % ordinary matter , 26.8 % dark matter and 68.3 % dark energy . Thus , dark matter constitutes 84.5 % Since dark energy , by convention , does not count as `` matter '' , this is 26.8 / ( 4.9 + 26.8 ) = 0.845 of total mass , while dark energy plus dark matter constitute 95.1 % of total mass -- energy content . The great majority of ordinary matter in the universe is also unseen , since visible stars and gas inside galaxies and clusters account for less than 10 % of the ordinary matter contribution to the mass-energy density of the universe . The most widely accepted hypothesis on the form for dark matter is that it is composed of weakly interacting massive particles ( WIMPs ) that interact only through gravity and the weak force .  The dark matter hypothesis plays a central role in current modeling of cosmic structure formation and galaxy formation and evolution and on explanations of the anisotropies observed in the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) . All these lines of evidence suggest that galaxies , galaxy clusters , and the universe as a whole contain far more matter than that which is observable via electromagnetic signals . Many experiments to detect proposed dark matter particles through non-gravitational means are under way ; however , no dark matter particle has been conclusively identified .   Although the existence of dark matter is generally accepted by most of the astronomical community , a minority of astronomers , motivated by the lack of conclusive identification of dark matter , argue for various modifications of the standard laws of general relativity , such as  MOND , TeVeS , and conformal gravity that attempt to account for the observations without invoking additional matter .",

      "The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is an American long-haul , mid-size widebody , twin-engine jet airliner made by Boeing Commercial Airplanes . Its variants seat 242 to 335 passengers in typical three-class seating configurations . It is a pioneering airliner with the use of composite materials as the primary material in the construction of its airframe . The 787 was designed to be 20 % more fuel efficient than the Boeing 767 , which it was intended to replace . The 787 Dreamliner 's distinguishing features include mostly electrical flight systems , raked wingtips , and noise-reducing chevrons on its engine nacelles . It shares a common type rating with the larger Boeing 777 to allow qualified pilots to operate both models .   The aircraft 's initial designation was the 7E7 , prior to its renaming in January 2005 . The first 787 was unveiled in a roll-out ceremony on July 8 , 2007 at Boeing 's Everett factory . Development and production of the 787 has involved a large-scale collaboration with numerous suppliers worldwide . Final assembly takes place at the Boeing Everett Factory in Everett , Washington , and at the Boeing South Carolina factory in North Charleston , South Carolina . Originally planned to enter service in May 2008 , the project experienced multiple delays . The airliner 's maiden flight took place on December 15 , 2009 , and completed flight testing in mid-2011 . Boeing has reportedly spent $ 32 billion on the 787 program .   Final US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) and European Aviation Safety Agency ( EASA ) type certification was received in August 2011 and the first 787-8 was delivered in September 2011 . It entered commercial service on October 26 , 2011 with launch customer All Nippon Airways . The stretched 787-9 variant , which is 20 ft longer and can fly 450 nmi farther than the -8 , first flew in September 2013 . Deliveries of the 787-9 began in July 2014 ; it entered commercial service on August 7 , 2014 with All Nippon Airways , with 787-9 launch customer Air New Zealand following two days later . As of April 2017 , the 787 had orders for 1,213 aircraft from 64 customers , with All Nippon Airways having the largest number on order .   The aircraft has suffered from several in-service problems , including fires on board related to its lithium-ion batteries . These systems were reviewed by both the FAA and the Japan Civil Aviation Bureau . The FAA issued a directive in January 2013 that grounded all 787s in the US and other civil aviation authorities followed suit . After Boeing completed tests on a revised battery design , the FAA approved the revised design and lifted the grounding in April 2013 ; the 787 returned to passenger service later that month .",

      "Robert Jay Brady ( November 8 , 1922 -- April 22 , 1996 ) was an American professional baseball player and a former Major League catcher . He appeared in four total games played over two seasons with the 1946 -- 47 Boston Braves , and spent 13 seasons ( 1940 -- 52 ) in minor league baseball . Born in Lewiston , Pennsylvania , Brady threw right-handed , batted left-handed , stood 6 ft tall and weighed 175 lb .   Brady made seven plate appearances in the big leagues , and collected one hit and one base on balls . His hit -- a pinch single -- came on September 8 , 1946 , against Tommy Hughes of the Philadelphia Phillies at Braves Field in the second game of a doubleheader . Hughes pitched a 4 -- 0 shutout victory against Boston .   One thing many people did not know was that at a young age Brady suffered from a bout of Scarlet Fever robbing him of his hearing in his left ear and minimal hearing in his right . Bob played just one year of high school baseball , his junior season . This was due to the fact that the high school had not sponsored a baseball program since 1936 and Bob left high school in the spring of his senior year to play minor league ball for Williamsport . Brady , along with his team , had an outstanding 1940 campaign as the Panthers went 9 -- 1 under coach Jay M. Riden . A 2 -- 0 loss to Juniata Joint was the only blemish of the season . In 10 games , Bob had 17 hits in 38 at -- bats for a .447 average . He drove -- in 10 runs and scored nine . The left -- handed hitter also stroked four doubles and had three triples . He played mostly first base but also saw time in the outfield and caught in one game . On August 24 , 1946 Bob played in his first major league game for the Boston Braves , now known as the Atlanta Braves . Brady appeared in two more games that season , going 1 -- for -- 5 at the plate . He also drew a walk . In 1947 Brady appeared in just one game , that coming on April 17 , going hitless in just one at -- bat . That game was to be Bob 's final one on the major league level .   During his professional career Brady was pretty much a catcher , spending 12 seasons in the minors mostly on the AAA level . In 1944 , his second with the Hartford Chiefs of the old Eastern League , his team won the league championship and he was the league 's all -- star catcher . He also saw time with Minneapolis of the American Association League where in one game he hit three home runs against Toledo . After his baseball career ended , Brady settled in Manchester , Connecticut and was employed by the State of Connecticut , in their purchasing department , retiring in 1983 .   Brady suffered a stroke in 1996 and passed in a matter of months .   Brady lived most of his life in Manchester , Connecticut , married to Virginia K. Brady . He loved fishing and playing golf .

      "In computer architecture , a branch target predictor is the part of a processor that predicts the target of a taken conditional branch or an unconditional branch instruction before the target of the branch instruction is computed by the execution unit of the processor .   Branch target prediction is not the same as branch prediction which attempts to guess whether a conditional branch will be taken or not-taken ( i.e. , sequential ) .   In more parallel processor designs , as the instruction cache latency grows longer and the fetch width grows wider , branch target extraction becomes a bottleneck . The recurrence is :   Instruction cache fetches block of instructions  Instructions in block are scanned to identify branches  First predicted taken branch is identified  Target of that branch is computed  Instruction fetch restarts at branch target   In machines where this recurrence takes two cycles , the machine loses one full cycle of fetch after every predicted taken branch . As predicted branches happen every 10 instructions or so , this can force a substantial drop in fetch bandwidth . Some machines with longer instruction cache latencies would have an even larger loss . To ameliorate the loss , some machines implement branch target prediction : given the address of a branch , they predict the target of that branch . A refinement of the idea predicts the start of a sequential run of instructions given the address of the start of the previous sequential run of instructions .   This predictor reduces the recurrence above to :   Hash the address of the first instruction in a run  Fetch the prediction for the addresses of the targets of branches in that run of instructions  Select the address corresponding to the branch predicted taken   As the predictor RAM can be 5 -- 10 % of the size of the instruction cache , the fetch happens much faster than the instruction cache fetch , and so this recurrence is much faster . If it were not fast enough , it could be parallelized , by predicting target addresses of target branches .",
      "The Stanford prison experiment ( SPE ) was an attempt to investigate the psychological effects of perceived power , focusing on the struggle between prisoners and prison guards . It was conducted at Stanford University on August 14 -- 20 , 1971 , by a research group led by psychology professor Philip Zimbardo using college students . It was funded by the U.S. Office of Naval Research as an investigation into the causes of difficulties between guards and prisoners in the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps . The experiment is a topic covered in most introductory psychology textbooks .   Some participants developed their roles as the guards and enforced authoritarian measures and ultimately subjected some prisoners to psychological torture . Many of the prisoners passively accepted psychological abuse and , by the guards ' request , actively harassed other prisoners who tried to stop it . Zimbardo , in his role as the superintendent , allowed abuse to continue . Two of the prisoners left mid-experiment , and the whole exercise was abandoned after six days following the objections of graduate student Christina Maslach , whom Zimbardo was dating ( and later married ) . Certain portions of the experiment were filmed , and excerpts of footage are publicly available .",

      "Weston ( Bath ) was a small railway station in Bath , England , about a mile west of Bath Green Park railway station on the Midland Railway line .   It was opened in 1869 when the Midland Railway 's Bath branch was opened . It was served by stopping trains to Mangotsfield and the Bristol Midland Railway terminus at St Philips or Bristol Temple Meads , via Bitton and Oldland Common .   Originally called just Weston , its name was altered to Weston ( Bath ) in 1934 to avoid confusion with Weston-super-Mare ( usually referred to by local people as just `` Weston '' ) . The station closed in 1953 , killed by competition from bus services , though the railway line through the station did not close until 1966 for passengers and 1971 for goods trains . The next station to the west on the same line , Kelston ( for Saltford ) , had closed at the end of 1948 . The line into St Philips closed on the same day as Weston .   The station was named after the Weston suburb of Bath , but was some distance from Weston village in the area called Lower Weston that now forms part of the Newbridge area of Bath .   The station building still exists and is used as offices , formerly including the studio of the now defunct Bath FM radio station .

She was the sister of well known Turkish painter and poet , Bedri Rahmi Ey\u00fcbo\u011flu , and Sabahattin Ey\u00fcbo\u011flu , an author , academic and translator . Her father , Mehmet Rahmi , was the Governor of Trabzon and a member of parliament chosen by Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk .   Her family moved to Istanbul , where she enrolled in a regular high school , unlike many of her peers who often attended all girls colleges . After graduating from high school , Ey\u00fcbo\u011flu was educated in fine arts at the Academy of Fine Arts in Istanbul and became an architect in 1942 . She later explained her family 's commitment to education , especially for women , saying , `` We grew up with Atat\u00fcrk 's reforms . That was what Atat\u00fcrk had indoctrinated in us . That we would finish school and serve our country . ''   After the academy , she began working in the small village of Hasano\u011flan , Ankara Province , where she facilitated the construction of a village institutes . The Turkish government was working to develop the small villages and communities of Anatolia at the time , and the village institutes were considered essential to educating its citizens . Ey\u00fcbo\u011flu later said in an interview :   Ey\u00fcbo\u011flu planned new institutes and schools in villages throughout rural Turkey during the 1940s . She caught malaria in 1947 , which forced her to leave Anatolia and move back to Istanbul . The government also ended its support for the village institute program during the 1950s , which forced her to settle in Istanbul .   She began working at the Istanbul Academy of Fine Arts once she recovered from malaria . However , she soon began traveling outside Istanbul again as an excavation architect . In 1948 , she met her future husband Robert Anhegger , a German scholar in the field of Ottoman and Turkish studies . The couple married in 1958 using an ancient wedding ring .  We got married in 1958 , in the 10th anniversary of our friendship . He proposed to me with a ring that was from the 4th century A.D. . After my father 's death , I was feeling lonely and I could n't resist his insistence anymore .   Ey\u00fcbo\u011flu began working as a restoration architect in Istanbul following her marriage . Her most famous restoration projects included the landmark Topkap\u0131 Palace 's harem section and Rumelihisar\u0131 . In 2008 she was given a special jury award for in the Achievement Award for special contribution in architecture at the Turkish National Architecture Awards in Ankara .   Ey\u00fcbo\u011flu and Anhegger bought an apartment in a legendary building in Istanbul 's Galata district in 1964 . She decorated her apartment with artifacts collected from throughout her travels in Anatolia . The couple remained married until Anhegger 's death in 2001 . She mourned the death of her husband , with whom she had been together for more than 40 years , `` I could n't accept his will to be cremated . After his cremation , I lived with his ashes in the house for a week . '' She continued to live at her residence following Anhegger 's death . Her goal was to donate her collection to a small museum . Unfortunately her wish was not realized , as her heirs sold the entire contents of that magical apartment to the highest bidder .   Mualla Ey\u00fcbo\u011flu Anhegger died on August 16 , 2009 , at the age of 90 . She was laid to rest at the Merkezefendi Cemetery following the religious funeral service at Te\u015fvikiye Mosque .",
      "Gustav Johannes Wied ( 6 March 1858 -- 24 October 1914 ) was a Danish writer .   The fifth of the eleven children of Carl August Wied and Catha Wied , Gustav was born in Branderslev near Nakskov .   He is generally known as a satirical critic of society in his time and he deliberately used his writing talents to expose the establishment , bourgeoisie and ruling class . The government had him imprisoned for 14 days in 1882 for a short story published in a newspaper . Wied wrote novels , short stories , poems and plays ( including several satyr plays ) .   His best-known work is the Livsens Ondskab ( 1899 ) novel , depicting life in a small provincial Danish town , with the customs official Knagsted as a red-bearded satyrical Diogenes openly ridiculing the hypocrisies of the snobbish bourgeois inhabitants , and Emanual Thomsen as a tragic struggler , trying to obtain the funds needed to regain his ancestral farm . In Knagsted ( 1902 ) he created a sequel , letting Knagsted comment on contemporary fashionable society in the Bohemian spa resort of Karlsbad ( Karlovy Vary ) .   He eventually lost popularity and suffered from severe stomach aches . Badly affected by his condition and despondent , he committed suicide with an overdose of potassium cyanide in 1914 .",

One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines , the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves .   Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines , perhaps the oldest through its inclusion of astronomy . Over the last two millennia , physics was a part of natural philosophy along with chemistry , biology , and certain branches of mathematics , but during the scientific revolution in the 17th century , the natural sciences emerged as unique research programs in their own right . Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research , such as biophysics and quantum chemistry , and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined . New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms of other sciences while opening new avenues of research in areas such as mathematics and philosophy .   Physics also makes significant contributions through advances in new technologies that arise from theoretical breakthroughs . For example , advances in the understanding of electromagnetism or nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society , such as television , computers , domestic appliances , and nuclear weapons ; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization , and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus .   The United Nations named 2005 the World Year of Physics .",

It is the largest island of a small , circular archipelago which bears the same name and is the remnant of a volcanic caldera . It forms the southernmost member of the Cyclades group of islands , with an area of approximately 73 km2 and a 2011 census population of 15,550 . The municipality of Santorini includes the inhabited islands of Santorini and Therasia and the uninhabited islands of Nea Kameni , Palaia Kameni , Aspronisi , and Christiana . The total land area is 90.623 km2 . Santorini is part of the Thira regional unit .   Santorini is essentially what remains after an enormous volcanic eruption that destroyed the earliest settlements on a formerly single island , and created the current geological caldera . A giant central , rectangular lagoon , which measures about 12 by , is surrounded by 300 m high , steep cliffs on three sides . The main island slopes downward to the Aegean Sea . On the fourth side , the lagoon is separated from the sea by another much smaller island called Therasia ; the lagoon is connected to the sea in two places , in the northwest and southwest . The depth of the caldera , at 400m , makes it impossible for any but the largest ships to anchor anywhere in the protected bay ; there is also a fisherman 's harbour at Vlychada , on the southwestern coast . The island 's principal port is Athinios . The capital , Fira , clings to the top of the cliff looking down on the lagoon . The volcanic rocks present from the prior eruptions feature olivine , and have a small presence of hornblende .   It is the most active volcanic centre in the South Aegean Volcanic Arc , though what remains today is chiefly a water-filled caldera . The volcanic arc is approximately 500 km long and 20 to wide . The region first became volcanically active around 3 -- 4 million years ago , though volcanism on Thera began around 2 million years ago with the extrusion of dacitic lavas from vents around the Akrotiri .   The island is the site of one of the largest volcanic eruptions in recorded history : the Minoan eruption ( sometimes called the Thera eruption ) , which occurred some 3,600 years ago at the height of the Minoan civilization . The eruption left a large caldera surrounded by volcanic ash deposits hundreds of metres deep and may have led indirectly to the collapse of the Minoan civilization on the island of Crete , 110 km to the south , through a gigantic tsunami . Another popular theory holds that the Thera eruption is the source of the legend of Atlantis .",

      "SpongeBob SquarePants is an American animated television series created by marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg for Nickelodeon . The series chronicles the adventures and endeavors of the title character and his various friends in the fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom . The series ' popularity has made it a media franchise , as well as the highest rated series to ever air on Nickelodeon , and the most distributed property of MTV Networks . As of 2015 , the media franchise has generated $ 12 billion in merchandising revenue for Nickelodeon .   Many of the ideas for the series originated in an unpublished educational comic book titled The Intertidal Zone , which Hillenburg created in 1989 . He began developing SpongeBob SquarePants into a television series in 1996 upon the cancellation of Rocko 's Modern Life , and turned to Tom Kenny , who had worked with him on that series , to voice the title character . SpongeBob was originally going to be named SpongeBoy , and the series was to be called SpongeBoy Ahoy ! , but these were both changed , as the name was already trademarked .   Nickelodeon held a preview for the series in the United States on May 1 , 1999 , following the television airing of the 1999 Kids ' Choice Awards . The series officially premiered on July 17 , 1999 . It has received worldwide critical acclaim since its premiere and gained enormous popularity by its second season . A feature film , The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie , was released in theaters on November 19 , 2004 , and a sequel was released on February 6 , 2015 . On October 15 , 2016 , the series began airing its current tenth season , beginning with the episode `` Whirly Brains '' . In May 2017 , the show was announced to be renewed for a 12th season .   The series has won a variety of awards , including six Annie Awards , eight Golden Reel Awards , two Emmy Awards , 12 Kids ' Choice Awards , and two BAFTA Children 's Awards . Despite its widespread popularity , the series has been involved in several public controversies , including one centered on speculation over SpongeBob 's intended sexual orientation , and another focusing on the perceived declining quality of the show 's content since the release of the first film . In 2011 , a newly described species of fungi , Spongiforma squarepantsii , was named after the cartoon 's title character .",

The royal state anthem of Montenegro at the time was To Our Beautiful Montenegro , while the education anthem was the Hymn to Saint Sava .   The music was composed by Davorin Jenko or Franjo Vimer , partly drawing upon a song of Garibaldi 's fighters , Si scopron le tombe , Si levano i morti , with words written by prince Nicholas I of Montenegro . Having words that were considered too inflammatory , evoking provocation of the Ottoman Empire , it could not be used as the official state anthem .   In 1992 the government of Montenegro considered using it as the official anthem , but decided against it . In 2003 it was nominated to be the official anthem of Serbia and Montenegro . There are some who believe that it should become the anthem of Montenegro in the future .   A variation of the song was created by the Bosnian Serbs in the beginning of the 20th century known as `` Here , o'er Here !

Later in his life he settled in the United Kingdom , where he was chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland between 1955 and 1965 .   Landale had a close connection with Jardine Matheson . His father , David Landale , was also chairman and managing director of the firm , and the Landales were distantly related to the family of Dr William Jardine , who was the founder of the Jardine trading house . Landale 's chairmanship of Jardine Matheson coincided with the outbreak of the Chinese Communist Revolution that followed the end of the Second World War . The turbulence prevented the firm from reviving the profitable China business that it had enjoyed in the past . In 1947 , he founded the Hong Kong Airways with a hope of developing the firm 's civil aviation business . The attempt , however , was hit by the growing instability of the region .   As the senior unofficial member of the Legislative Council , Landale was an active critic of the Hong Kong government who was noted for his unsuccessful attempt to oppose the government 's plan of re-introducing income tax after the war in 1947 . Besides , he moved a motion in the Council in 1949 to debate the `` Young Plan '' . The plan , which proposed for the idea of setting up a Municipal Council , was highly questioned by him and other unofficial members , who believed that reforming the Legislative Council would be a better alternative . Nevertheless , having considered the regional instability and the lukewarm response from the general public , the British government announced in 1952 that no major constitutional reform would take place in Hong Kong ."

      "The American Civil War was fought in the United States from 1861 to 1865 . After a long standing controversy over slavery and state 's rights , war broke out in April 1861 , when Confederates attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina , shortly after Abraham Lincoln was elected . The nationalists of the Union proclaimed loyalty to the U.S. Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States of America advocating states ' rights to perpetual slavery and its expansion in the Americas .   Among the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states individually declared their secession from the U.S. to form the Confederate States of America . The Confederacy grew to include eleven states ; it claimed two more border states ( Kentucky and Missouri ) , the Indian Territory , and the southern portions of the Union 's western territories of Arizona and New Mexico , which was organized and incorporated into the Confederacy as Confederate Arizona . The Confederacy was never diplomatically recognized by the United States government , nor was it recognized by any foreign country ( although Britain and France granted it belligerent status ) . The states that remained loyal , including the border states where slavery was legal , were known as the Union or the North .   The North and South quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over four years . During this time many innovations in warfare occurred , including the development and use of iron-clad ships , ultimately changing naval strategy around the world . The Union finally won the war when General Robert E. Lee surrendered to General Ulysses S. Grant at the battle of Appomattox , which triggered a series of surrenders by Confederate generals throughout the southern states . Four years of intense combat left 620,000 to 750,000 soldiers dead , a higher number than the number of American military deaths in World War I and World War II combined , and much of the South 's infrastructure was destroyed . The Confederacy collapsed , slavery was abolished and 4 million slaves were freed . The Reconstruction Era ( 1863 -- 1877 ) overlapped and followed the war , with the process of restoring national unity , strengthening the national government , and granting civil rights to freed slaves throughout the country . The Civil War is arguably the most studied and written about episode in American history .",

      "The Great Indian Novel is a satirical novel by Shashi Tharoor . It is a fictional work that takes the story of the Mahabharata , the epic of Hindu mythology , and recasts and resets it in the context of the Indian Independence Movement and the first three decades post-independence . Figures from Indian history are transformed into characters from mythology , and the mythical story of India is retold as a history of Indian independence and subsequent history , up through the 1980s . Some critics have identified an element of subversion in the novel . The work includes numerous puns and allusions to famous works about India , such as those by Rudyard Kipling , Paul Scott , and E. M. Forster .   The Mahabharata is an epic tale describing the historical dynastic struggle over the throne of the kingdom of Hastinapur between the Pandavas and the Kauravas , two branches of the heirs of the King Shantanu . In his novel , Tharoor recasts the story of the nascent Indian democracy as a struggle between groups and individuals closely related by their personal and political histories . Through his cantankerous narrator , Tharoor takes an irreverent tone towards figures such as Mohandas Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru , who are ordinarily treated with reverence by Indians .   The phrase `` great Indian novel '' is an allusion to the long-standing idea of the `` Great American Novel '' and is also a pun , roughly translating `` Mahabharata '' ( \u092e\u0939\u0924\u094d `` great '' ; Bharata `` India '' ) . The Mahabharata , which is not a novel but an epic poem , can be understood , according to Tharoor , to represent Hinduism 's greatest literary achievement and thus serves as an appropriate paradigm in which to frame a retelling of recent Indian history .   A significant characteristic of Tharoor 's version of the story is the emphasis on the older generations ( e.g. , Bhishma , Dhritarashtra , and Pandu ) and the resulting de-emphasis on the actions of the Kauravas and the Pandavas .",
      "Byrne is the English author Anthony Burgess 's last novel , published posthumously in 1995 .   Composed mostly in the same ottava rima stanzas that Byron used for his Don Juan , the story follows the fortunes of Michael Byrne , an Irishman with some Spanish ancestors who settled in Ireland after a war between England 's Royal Navy and the Spanish Armada in the 16th century .   He thought he was a kind of living myth  And hence deserving of ottima rima ,  The scheme that Ariosto juggled with ,  Apt for a lecherous defective dreamer .  He 'd have preferred a stronger-muscled smith ,  Anvilling rhymes amid poetic steam , a  Sort of Lord Byron . Byron was long dead .  This poetaster had to do instead .   A painter and composer whose career is never as spectacular as his ambitions , and a determined womanizer who fathers children across the globe , Byrne becomes embroiled with the Nazi regime in 1930s Germany .   A heavy task , but there was light relief  In the Germanic ambience , boisterous , brash ,  Torchlit parades and pogroms , guttural grief  In emigration queues , the smash and crash  Of pawnshop windows by insentient beef  In uniform , the gush of beer , the splash  Of schnapps , the joy of being drunk and Aryan ,  Though Hitler was a teetotalitarian .   Eventually he vanishes , presumed dead in Africa . But years later , his twin sons , now middle-aged , one a doubting priest , the other suffering from a debilitating disease , receive from Byrne , who is still alive , an invitation to London , where he will read his last will and testament .",

      "The Vandals were an East Germanic tribe , or group of tribes , who were first heard of in southern Poland , but later moved around Europe establishing kingdoms in Spain and later North Africa in the 5th century .   The Vandals are believed to have migrated from southern Scandinavia to the area between the lower Oder and Vistula rivers during the 2nd century BC and to have settled in Silesia from around 120 BC . They are associated with the Przeworsk culture and were possibly the same people as the Lugii . Expanding into Dacia during the Marcomannic Wars and to Pannonia during the Crisis of the Third Century , the Vandals were confined to Pannonia by the Goths around 330 AD , where they received permission to settle by Constantine the Great . Around 400 , raids by the Huns forced many of the Germanic tribes like the Goths to migrate to the Roman Empire , and fearing that they might be targeted next , the Vandals were pushed westwards crossing the Rhine into Gaul along with other tribes in 406 . In 409 , the Vandals crossed the Pyrenees into the Iberian Peninsula , where their main groups , the Hasdingi and the Silingi , settled in Gallaecia ( northwest ) and Baetica ( south central ) respectively .   After the Visigoths invaded Iberia , the Iranian Alans and Silingi Vandals voluntarily subjected to the rule of Hasdingian leader Gunderic , who was pushed from Gallaecia to Baetica by a Roman-Suebi coalition in 419 . In 429 , under king Genseric , the Vandals entered North Africa . By 439 they established a kingdom which included the Roman province of Africa as well as Sicily , Corsica , Sardinia , Malta and the Balearic Islands . They fended off several Roman attempts to recapture the African province , and sacked the city of Rome in 455 . Their kingdom collapsed in the Vandalic War of 533 -- 4 , in which Justinian I managed to reconquer the province for the Eastern Roman Empire .   Renaissance and Early Modern writers characterized the Vandals as barbarians , `` sacking and looting '' Rome . This led to the use of the term `` vandalism '' to describe any senseless destruction , particularly the `` barbarian '' defacing of artwork . However , modern historians tend to regard the Vandals during the transitional period from Late Antiquity to the Early Middle Ages as perpetuators , not destroyers , of Roman culture .",

      "A wig-wag is a device for flashing an automobile 's headlamps at a preset rate . In its traditional form a wig-wag constitutes the illuminating of the right and left headlamps alternately , with each lamp lit for around half a second at a time . In the United Kingdom the wig-wag is only seen on the road on emergency vehicles . The ` standard ' wig-wag is often used within a cycle of other illumination patterns , such as swiftly alternating the left and right headlights , alternating the left and right headlights slowly , or flashing both headlights together , and using a mixture of high - and low - / dipped-beams .   Although the use of flashing headlights does increase the visibility of any vehicle , it can also create problems . In situations when highbeam headlights are flashed , the wig-wag may create glare or may otherwise temporarily blind the drivers of oncoming vehicles .   Generally , wig-wags are prohibited on all vehicles except emergency vehicles . However the road rules in New South Wales , Australia , and some areas in the United States allow school buses to have flashing headlights . In New South Wales specifically additional Wig-Wag lights ( separate from the headlights ) are used on all public transport buses .",

      "The Late Glacial ( c. 13,000 -- 10,000 years ago ) , or Tardiglacial ( `` Late Glacial '' ) , is defined primarily by the beginning of the modern warm period , in which climates in the Northern Hemisphere warmed substantially , causing a process of accelerated deglaciation following the Last Glacial Maximum ( c. 25,000 -- 13,000 years ago ) . At this time , human populations , previously forced into refuge areas as a result of Last Glacial Maximum climatic conditions , gradually begin to repopulate the Northern Hemisphere 's Eurasian landmass and eventually populate North America via Beringia for the first time .   Evidence for its occurrence stems from two main types of analysis . The first is the use of oxygen isotope stages ( OIS ) gathered from stratified deep-sea sediment cores . Samples are gathered and measured for change in isotope levels to determine temperature fluctuation for given periods of time . The second is a proxy measurement , the observation of certain reappearing fauna and flora fossils that can survive only in temperate climates , thus indicating warming trends for a given geographic area .   Archaeological evidence of settlement and resettlement in certain areas by humans also serve as proxy measurements . Towards the end of OIS 2 in which the Late Glacial Maximum occurs , the deep-sea sediment cores indicate a gradually warming climate , and the reappearance of certain warm-weather flora and fauna remains throughout the Northern Hemisphere correlate with that trend . A period of relatively brief cold oscillation , referred to as the Younger Dryas , is detected during OIS 2 , as can be inferred from an increase in isotope weight .",

He was ordained into the Church of Ireland in 1790 . Two sermons , preached in the college chapel in 1798 and 1799 , form the basis of his Discourses on the Scriptural Doctrines of Atonement and Sacrifice ( 1801 ) , a polemic against Unitarian theology , which was answered by Lant Carpenter .   He was appointed professor of mathematics and senior fellow of Trinity in 1800 , but resigned in 1812 to undertake the charge of the livings of Cappagh , County Tyrone , and Killyleagh , County Down . He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1813 as `` a gentleman of high distinction for mathematical & philosophical knowledge & Author of several works of importance '' .

It is the country 's political , cultural , economic , and academic center . It was known in the Roman period under the name Scupi .   The territory of Skopje has been inhabited since at least 4000 BC ; remains of Neolithic settlements have been found within the old Kale Fortress that overlooks the modern city centre . On the eve of the 1st century AD , the settlement was seized by the Romans and became a military camp . When the Roman Empire was divided into eastern and western halves in 395 AD , Scupi came under Byzantine rule from Constantinople . During much of the early medieval period , the town was contested between the Byzantines and the Bulgarian Empire , whose capital it was between 972 and 992 . From 1282 , the town was part of the Serbian Empire and acted as its capital city from 1346 to 1371 . In 1392 , the city was conquered by the Ottoman Turks who called the town \u00dcsk\u00fcp . The town stayed under Turkish control for over 500 years , serving as the capital of pashasanjak of \u00dcsk\u00fcb and later the Vilayet of Kosovo . At that time the city was famous for its oriental architecture . In 1912 , it was annexed by the Kingdom of Serbia during the Balkan Wars and after the First World War the city became part of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes ( Kingdom of Yugoslavia ) . In the Second World War the city was conquered by the Bulgarian Army , which was part of the Axis powers . In 1944 , it became the capital city of Democratic Macedonia ( later Socialist Republic of Macedonia ) , which was a federal state , part of Democratic Federal Yugoslavia ( later Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ) . The city developed rapidly after World War II , but this trend was interrupted in 1963 when it was hit by a disastrous earthquake . In 1991 , it became the capital city of an independent Macedonia .   Skopje is located on the upper course of the Vardar River , and is located on a major north-south Balkan route between Belgrade and Athens . It is a center for metal-processing , chemical , timber , textile , leather , and printing industries . Industrial development of the city has been accompanied by development of the trade , logistics , and banking sectors , as well as an emphasis on the fields of transportation , culture and sport . According to the last official count from 2002 , Skopje has a population of 506,926 inhabitants ; according to two more recent unofficial estimates , the city has a population of 668,518 or 491,000 inhabitants .",

A medium-sized market town in the medieval period , Birmingham grew to international prominence in the 18th century at the heart of the Midlands Enlightenment and subsequent Industrial Revolution , which saw the town at the forefront of worldwide advances in science , technology , and economic development , producing a series of innovations that laid many of the foundations of modern industrial society . By 1791 it was being hailed as `` the first manufacturing town in the world '' . Birmingham 's distinctive economic profile , with thousands of small workshops practising a wide variety of specialised and highly skilled trades , encouraged exceptional levels of creativity and innovation and provided a diverse and resilient economic base for industrial prosperity that was to last into the final quarter of the 20th century . Perhaps the most important invention in British history , the industrial steam engine , was invented in Birmingham . Its resulting high level of social mobility also fostered a culture of broad-based political radicalism , that under leaders from Thomas Attwood to Joseph Chamberlain was to give it a political influence unparalleled in Britain outside London , and a pivotal role in the development of British democracy . From the summer of 1940 to the spring of 1943 , Birmingham was bombed heavily by the German Luftwaffe in what is known as the Birmingham Blitz . The damage done to the city 's infrastructure , in addition to a deliberate policy of demolition and new building by planners , led to extensive demolition and redevelopment in subsequent decades .   Today Birmingham 's economy is dominated by the service sector . The city is a major international commercial centre , ranked as a gamma + world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ; and an important transport , retail , events and conference hub . Its metropolitan economy is the second largest in the United Kingdom with a GDP of $ 121.1 bn ( 2014 ) , and its six universities make it the largest centre of higher education in the country outside London . Birmingham 's major cultural institutions -- including the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra , the Birmingham Royal Ballet , the Birmingham Repertory Theatre , the Library of Birmingham and the Barber Institute of Fine Arts -- enjoy international reputations , and the city has vibrant and influential grassroots art , music , literary and culinary scenes . Birmingham is the fourth-most visited city in the UK by foreign visitors .   Birmingham 's sporting heritage can be felt worldwide , with the concept of the Football League and lawn tennis both originating from the city . Its most successful football club Aston Villa has won seven league titles and one European Cup with the other professional club being Birmingham City .   People from Birmingham are called Brummies , a term derived from the city 's nickname of Brum . This originates from the city 's dialect name , Brummagem , which may in turn have been derived from one of the city 's earlier names , Bromwicham . There is a distinctive Brummie accent and dialect .",

      "Miss Wyoming is a novel by Douglas Coupland . It was first published by Random House of Canada in January 2000 .   The novel follows two protagonists , Susan Colgate , a former Miss Wyoming , and John Johnson , a former action film producer . Both have experienced early success but now find themselves in terminal career decline and with a host of personal problems . When circumstances intervene to offer routes out of their lives and then to bring them together , they are afforded the opportunity to discover themselves and to brighten their futures .   The title concretely derives from a plot point in the book in which a driven stage mother moves the family to Wyoming because it is the easiest state from which to land contestants in national competitions , though it has been noted that the title also comments on the peculiar notion of longing for something a person has n't experienced herself .",

      "A thunderstorm , also known as an electrical storm , lightning storm , or thundershower , is a storm characterized by the presence of lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth 's atmosphere , known as thunder . Thunderstorms occur in association with a type of cloud known as a cumulonimbus . They are usually accompanied by strong winds , heavy rain , and sometimes snow , sleet , hail , or , in contrast , no precipitation at all . Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband , known as a squall line . Strong or severe thunderstorms , known as supercells , rotate as do cyclones . While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy , vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction .   Thunderstorms result from the rapid upward movement of warm , moist air , sometimes along a front . As the warm , moist air moves upward , it cools , condenses , and forms a cumulonimbus cloud that can reach heights of over 20 km . As the rising air reaches its dew point temperature , water vapor condenses into water droplets or ice , reducing pressure locally within the thunderstorm cell . Any precipitation falls the long distance through the clouds towards the Earth 's surface . As the droplets fall , they collide with other droplets and become larger . The falling droplets create a downdraft as it pulls cold air with it , and this cold air spreads out at the Earth 's surface , occasionally causing strong winds that are commonly associated with thunderstorms .   Thunderstorms can form and develop in any geographic location but most frequently within the mid-latitude , where warm , moist air from tropical latitudes collides with cooler air from polar latitudes . Thunderstorms are responsible for the development and formation of many severe weather phenomena . Thunderstorms , and the phenomena that occur along with them , pose great hazards . Damage that results from thunderstorms is mainly inflicted by downburst winds , large hailstones , and flash flooding caused by heavy precipitation . Stronger thunderstorm cells are capable of producing tornadoes and waterspouts .   There are four types of thunderstorms : single-cell , multi-cell cluster , multi-cell lines , and supercells . Supercell thunderstorms are the strongest and the most associated with severe weather phenomena . Mesoscale convective systems formed by favorable vertical wind shear within the tropics and subtropics can be responsible for the development of hurricanes . Dry thunderstorms , with no precipitation , can cause the outbreak of wildfires from the heat generated from the cloud-to-ground lightning that accompanies them . Several means are used to study thunderstorms : weather radar , weather stations , and video photography . Past civilizations held various myths concerning thunderstorms and their development as late as the 18th century . Beyond the Earth 's atmosphere , thunderstorms have also been observed on the planets of Jupiter , Saturn , Neptune , and , probably , Venus .",

Happersett ruling was based on an interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . The Supreme Court readily accepted that Minor was a citizen of the United States , but it held that the constitutionally protected privileges of citizenship did not include the right to vote .   The Nineteenth Amendment , which became a part of the Constitution in 1920 , effectively overruled Minor v. Happersett by prohibiting discrimination in voting rights based on gender . Minor v. Happersett continued to be cited in support of restrictive election laws of other types until the 1960s , when the Supreme Court started interpreting the Fourteenth Amendment 's Equal Protection Clause to guarantee voting rights ."

      "Hybrid automatic repeat request ( hybrid ARQ or HARQ ) is a combination of high-rate forward error-correcting coding and ARQ error-control . In standard ARQ , redundant bits are added to data to be transmitted using an error-detecting ( ED ) code such as a cyclic redundancy check ( CRC ) . Receivers detecting a corrupted message will request a new message from the sender . In Hybrid ARQ , the original data is encoded with a forward error correction ( FEC ) code , and the parity bits are either immediately sent along with the message or only transmitted upon request when a receiver detects an erroneous message . The ED code may be omitted when a code is used that can perform both forward error correction ( FEC ) in addition to error detection , such as a Reed-Solomon code . The FEC code is chosen to correct an expected subset of all errors that may occur , while the ARQ method is used as a fall-back to correct errors that are uncorrectable using only the redundancy sent in the initial transmission . As a result , hybrid ARQ performs better than ordinary ARQ in poor signal conditions , but in its simplest form this comes at the expense of significantly lower throughput in good signal conditions . There is typically a signal quality cross-over point below which simple hybrid ARQ is better , and above which basic ARQ is better .",

      "1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania was an oral ultimatum presented to Juozas Urb\u0161ys , Foreign Minister of Lithuania , by Joachim von Ribbentrop , Foreign Minister of Nazi Germany , on 20 March 1939 . The Germans demanded that Lithuania give up the Klaip\u0117da Region ( also known as the Memel Territory ) , which had been detached from Germany after World War I , or the Wehrmacht would invade Lithuania . After years of rising tension between Lithuania and Germany , increasing pro-Nazi propaganda in the region , and continued German expansion , the demand was expected . The ultimatum was issued just five days after the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia . The four signatories of the 1924 Klaip\u0117da Convention , which had guaranteed the protection of the status quo in the region , did not offer any material assistance . The United Kingdom and France followed a policy of appeasement , while Italy and Japan openly supported Germany . Lithuania was forced to accept the ultimatum on 22 March . For Germany it was the last territorial acquisition before World War II ; for Lithuania it was a major downturn in economy and morale ; for Europe it was further escalation in pre-war tensions .",

      "Tepe Hissar is a prehistoric site located just south of Damghan in north-eastern Iran . The site was firstly discovered in 1877 by A. Houtum Schindler and then investigated in 1931 and 1932 by E.F. Schmidt , on behalf of the University of Pennsylvania Museum ( Schmidt 1933 , 1937 ) . A surface survey was carried out in 1972 , while in 1976 a re-study project was performed , utilizing modern methods of stratigraphic assessments , ceramic typological analysis and radiocarbon dating , by the University of Pennsylvania Museum , the University of Turin and the Iran Center for Archaeological Research ( Dyson and Howard , 1989 ) . Other researches , rescue excavations and salvage works were done in the 90s .   The site is notable for its uninterrupted occupational history from the 5th to the 2nd millennium BCE . The quantity and elaborateness of its excavated artifacts and funerary customs position the site prominently as a cultural bridge between Mesopotamia and Central Asia .   The human occupation has been divided into three major periods ( I , II and III ) ( Voigt and Dyson 1992 ) . The earliest dating is uncertain but established as after 5000 BCE in the Chalcolithic period . This period ( Hissar IA and IB ) is characterized by mud-bricks buildings and hand-made ( IA ) and fine wheel-made ( IB ) ware , decorated with geometric , plant and animal patterns . The most widespread shapes are represented by small cups , bowls and vases . In the second period ( Hissar IIA and IIB ) , dated to the 4th millennium BC and the beginning of the 3rd , the burnished grey ware becomes predominant and the large number of lapis lazuli beads and alabaster finds , as well as the evidence of large-scale production of copper-based alloys and lead-silver , suggests that the site was playing a very important role in the trade and export of metal artifacts and semi-precious stones from the Middle Asia quarries to Mesopotamia and Egypt . The third period of development ( Hissar IIIA , IIIB and IIIC , chronologically attributed to the second half of the 3rd millennium BC and the beginning of the 2nd ( Bronze Age ) , can be described as a proto-urban phase , mainly characterized by increased wealth , demographic concentration , mass production of plain ware and the construction of large public and ceremonial buildings . Among these , the Burned Building of Hissar IIIB phase is worth mentioning . It has been variously interpreted due to the richness of its contents and the presence of burned human bodies and flint arrowheads ( Dyson 1972 ) . Firstly interpreted as a fortification , the discovery of a small fire altar suggests that it may be a shrine ( Dyson and Remsen 1989 ) . Significant changes happened at the end of the 3rd millennium BC . The well-planned architecture of period Hissar IIIB was abandoned and replaced by the poorly organized structures of the Hissar IIIC period , laid out without regard to the plan of the earlier settlement . Moreover , we can mention the first appearance of truly elite burials , such as those of the so-called `` Warriors '' , the `` Priest '' and the `` Little Girl '' ( Schmidt 1933 ) , some of them contained BMAC items such as grooved stone columns .   In 1931-32 E.F. Schmidt recorded about eight hundred burials , of which only some have been fully described and published : 33 for the period Hissar I , 24 for Hissar II and 38 for Hissar III . Most of the graves are represented by individual burial in simple pits , with the skeleton laying on its side , in a flexed position and the skull oriented towards east and north-east . Some collective graves are attested and four rich graves of the Hissar IIIC period were found in 1931 .   The subsistence economy was based on agriculture . From Hissar II onward plant remains indicate `` an agricultural system based on cereals -LSB- glume and free-threshing wheats , naked and hulled barley -RSB- and the utilization of local fruit -LSB- olive , grapevine -RSB- plant resources '' ( Costantini and Dyson , p. 66 ) . Lentil seeds , peas and legumes were also present . Animal ( cattle , goat and sheep ) figurines indicate herding activities ( Mashkour 1998 ) .   The presence of full-time specialists seems to be attested already in the first Chalcolithic period . Regarding the metal production , in Hissar I were made both weapons ( daggers , knife blades , arrowheads ) and other tools ( pins , tacks , points and needles ) . In Hissar II and III copper artifacts increase in quality and variety and include personal ornaments ( earrings , pendants , bracelets , bands ) , tools and weapons ( bidents , lances , mattocks , chisels , mace heads ) , and luxury items ( vessels , mirrors , boxes and intricately cast pins and rods ) ."

      "Benjamin Franklin FRS , FRSE ( April 17 , 1790 ) was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States . Franklin was a renowned polymath and a leading author , printer , political theorist , politician , freemason , postmaster , scientist , inventor , civic activist , statesman , and diplomat . As a scientist , he was a major figure in the American Enlightenment and the history of physics for his discoveries and theories regarding electricity . As an inventor , he is known for the lightning rod , bifocals , and the Franklin stove , among other inventions . He facilitated many civic organizations , including Philadelphia 's fire department and the University of Pennsylvania , an Ivy League institution .   Franklin earned the title of `` The First American '' for his early and indefatigable campaigning for colonial unity , initially as an author and spokesman in London for several colonies . As the first United States Ambassador to France , he exemplified the emerging American nation . Franklin was foundational in defining the American ethos as a marriage of the practical values of thrift , hard work , education , community spirit , self-governing institutions , and opposition to authoritarianism both political and religious , with the scientific and tolerant values of the Enlightenment . In the words of historian Henry Steele Commager , `` In a Franklin could be merged the virtues of Puritanism without its defects , the illumination of the Enlightenment without its heat . '' To Walter Isaacson , this makes Franklin `` the most accomplished American of his age and the most influential in inventing the type of society America would become . ''   Franklin became a successful newspaper editor and printer in Philadelphia , the leading city in the colonies , publishing the Pennsylvania Gazette at the age of 23 . He became wealthy publishing this and Poor Richard 's Almanack , which he authored under the pseudonym `` Richard Saunders '' . After 1767 , he was associated with the Pennsylvania Chronicle , a newspaper that was known for its revolutionary sentiments and criticisms of the British policies .   He pioneered and was first president of The Academy and College of Philadelphia which opened in 1751 and later became the University of Pennsylvania . He organized and was the first secretary of the American Philosophical Society and was elected president in 1769 . Franklin became a national hero in America as an agent for several colonies when he spearheaded an effort in London to have the Parliament of Great Britain repeal the unpopular Stamp Act . An accomplished diplomat , he was widely admired among the French as American minister to Paris and was a major figure in the development of positive Franco-American relations . His efforts proved vital for the American Revolution in securing shipments of crucial munitions from France .   He was promoted to deputy postmaster-general for the British colonies in 1753 , having been Philadelphia postmaster for many years , and this enabled him to set up the first national communications network . During the Revolution , he became the first US Postmaster General . He was active in community affairs and colonial and state politics , as well as national and international affairs . From 1785 to 1788 , he served as governor of Pennsylvania . He initially owned and dealt in slaves but , by the 1750s , he argued against slavery from an economic perspective and became one of the most prominent abolitionists .   His colorful life and legacy of scientific and political achievement , and his status as one of America 's most influential Founding Fathers have seen Franklin honored more than two centuries after his death on coinage and the $ 100 bill , warships , and the names of many towns , counties , educational institutions , and corporations , as well as countless cultural references .",

      "Brown University is a private Ivy League research university in Providence , Rhode Island , United States , founded in 1764 as `` The College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations . '' Brown is the seventh-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine Colonial Colleges established before the American Revolution .   At its foundation , Brown was the first college in the United States to accept students regardless of their religious affiliation . Its engineering program was established in 1847 and was the first in the Ivy League . It was one of the early doctoral-granting U.S. institutions in the late 19th century , adding master and doctoral studies in 1887 . Brown 's New Curriculum is sometimes referred to in education theory as the Brown Curriculum and was adopted by faculty vote in 1969 after a period of student lobbying . The New Curriculum eliminated mandatory `` general education '' distribution requirements , made students `` the architects of their own syllabus , '' and allowed them to take any course for a grade of satisfactory or unrecorded no-credit . In 1971 , Brown 's coordinate women 's institution Pembroke College was fully merged into the university . Pembroke Campus now operates as a place for dorms and classrooms .   Undergraduate admissions is very selective , with an acceptance rate of 8.3 percent for the class of 2021 , according to the university .

      "Providence is the capital of and most populous city in the U.S. state of Rhode Island , founded in 1636 , and one of the oldest cities in the United States . It is located in Providence County and is the third most populous city in New England , after Boston and Worcester . Providence has a city population of 179,154 ; it is also part of the Providence metropolitan area which extends into southern Massachusetts . The Providence metropolitan area has an estimated population of 1,604,291 , which exceeds that of Rhode Island as a whole by about 60 % . This can be considered , in turn , to be part of the Greater Boston commuting area , which contains 7.6 million people .   Providence was founded by Roger Williams , a religious exile from the Massachusetts Bay Colony . He named the area in honor of `` God 's merciful Providence '' , which he believed was responsible for revealing such a haven for him and his followers to settle . The city is situated at the mouth of the Providence River at the head of Narragansett Bay .   Providence was one of the first cities in the country to industrialize and became noted for its textile manufacturing and subsequent machine tool , jewelry , and silverware industries . Today , the city of Providence is home to eight hospitals and seven institutions of higher learning which have shifted the city 's economy into service industries , though it still retains some manufacturing activity . The city was once nicknamed the `` Beehive of Industry '' ; it began rebranding itself as the `` Creative Capital '' in 2009 to emphasize its educational resources and arts community .",

      "The Pentium II brand refers to Intel 's sixth-generation microarchitecture ( `` P6 '' ) and x86-compatible microprocessors introduced on May 7 , 1997 . Containing 7.5 million transistors ( 27.4 million in the case of the mobile Dixon with 256 KB L2 cache ) , the Pentium II featured an improved version of the first P6-generation core of the Pentium Pro , which contained 5.5 million transistors . However , its L2 cache subsystem was a downgrade when compared to Pentium Pros . In early 1999 , the Pentium II was superseded by the almost identical Pentium III , which basically only added SSE instructions to the CPU .   In 1998 , Intel stratified the Pentium II family by releasing the Pentium II-based Celeron line of processors for low-end workstations and the Pentium II Xeon line for servers and high-end workstations . The Celeron was characterized by a reduced or omitted ( in some cases present but disabled ) on-die full-speed L2 cache and a 66 MT/s FSB . The Xeon was characterized by a range of full-speed L2 cache ( from 512 KB to 2048 KB ) , a 100 MT/s FSB , a different physical interface ( Slot 2 ) , and support for symmetric multiprocessing .",

      "Charles Andr\u00e9 Joseph Marie de Gaulle ( -LSB- \u0283a\u0281l d\u0259 \u0261ol -RSB- ; 22 November 1890 -- 9 November 1970 ) was a French general and statesman . He was the leader of Free France ( 1940 -- 44 ) and the head of the Provisional Government of the French Republic ( 1944 -- 46 ) . In 1958 , he founded the Fifth Republic and was elected as the President of France , a position he held until his resignation in 1969 . He was the dominant figure of France during the Cold War era and his memory continues to influence French politics .   Born in Lille , he graduated from Saint-Cyr in 1912 . He was a decorated officer of the First World War , wounded several times , and later taken prisoner at Verdun . During the interwar period , he advocated mobile armoured divisions . During the German invasion of May 1940 , he led an armoured division which counterattacked the invaders ; he was then appointed Under-Secretary for War . Refusing to accept his government 's armistice with Nazi Germany , de Gaulle exhorted the French population to resist occupation and to continue the fight in his Appeal of 18 June . He led a government in exile and the Free French Forces against the Axis . Despite frosty relations with Britain and especially the United States , he emerged as the undisputed leader of the French resistance . He became Head of the Provisional Government of the French Republic in June 1944 , the interim government of France following its Liberation . As early as 1944 , de Gaulle introduced a dirigiste economic policy , which included substantial state-directed control over a capitalist economy which was followed by thirty years of unprecedented growth .   Frustrated by the return of petty partisanship in the new Fourth Republic , he resigned in early 1946 but continued to be politically active as founder of the RPF party . He retired in the early 1950s and wrote his War Memoirs , which quickly became a classic of modern French literature . When the Algerian War was ripping apart the unstable Fourth Republic , the National Assembly brought him back to power during the May 1958 crisis . De Gaulle founded the Fifth Republic with a strong presidency , and he was elected in that role . He managed to keep France together while taking steps to end the war , much to the anger of the Pieds-Noirs ( Frenchmen settled in Algeria ) and the military ; both previously had supported his return to power to maintain colonial rule . He granted independence to Algeria and progressively to other French colonies .   In the context of the Cold War , de Gaulle initiated his `` Politics of Grandeur '' , asserting that France as a major power should not rely on other countries , such as the US , for its national security and prosperity . To this end , de Gaulle pursued a policy of `` national independence '' which led him to withdraw from NATO 's military integrated command and to launch an independent nuclear development program that made France the fourth nuclear power . He restored cordial Franco-German relations to create a European counterweight between the Anglo-American and Soviet spheres of influence . However , he opposed any development of a supranational Europe , favouring a Europe of sovereign nations . De Gaulle openly criticised the US intervention in Vietnam and the `` exorbitant privilege '' of the US dollar . In his later years , his support for an independent Quebec and his two vetoes against Britain 's entry into the European Community generated considerable controversy .   Although re-elected President in 1965 , in May 1968 he appeared likely to lose power amid widespread protests by students and workers but survived the crisis with backing from the Army and won an election with an increased majority in the Assembly . De Gaulle resigned in 1969 after losing a referendum in which he proposed more decentralization . He died a year later at his residence in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises , leaving his Presidential memoirs unfinished . Many French political parties and figures claim the Gaullist legacy .   De Gaulle was ranked as `` Le Plus Grand Fran\u00e7ais de tous les temps '' ( the Greatest Frenchman of All Time ) .",

      "A rowbike is an example of a rowing cycle , hybrid fitness/transport machine that combines a bicycle , and a rowing machine . `` Rowbike '' is a trademark of the Rowbike company . The Rowbike was invented by Scott Olson , the creator of Rollerblade inline skates . `` Rowling '' is a combination of rowing and rolling and is sometimes used in place of rowing when describing a rowbike .   A rowbike is different from a bicycle in that a bicycle is powered by pedals utilizing the rider 's legs , yet a Rowbike is powered utilizing the rowlers legs , back , core and arms as they engage in the back and forth , rowing motion . Rowbikes are marketed to people who desire a zero impact , total body exercise which is provided by rowing .

      "Richard Milhous Nixon ( January 9 , 1913 -- April 22 , 1994 ) was an American politician who served as the 37th President of the United States from 1969 until 1974 , when he became the only U.S. president to resign from office . He had previously served as the 36th Vice President of the United States from 1953 to 1961 under the presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower , and prior to that as a U.S. Representative and also Senator from California .   Nixon was born in Yorba Linda , California . After completing his undergraduate studies at Whittier College , he graduated from Duke University School of Law in 1937 and returned to California to practice law . He and his wife Pat moved to Washington in 1942 to work for the federal government . He subsequently served on active duty in the U.S. Navy Reserve during World War II . Nixon was elected to the House of Representatives in 1946 and to the Senate in 1950 . His pursuit of the Hiss Case established his reputation as a leading anti-communist , and elevated him to national prominence . He was the running mate of Dwight D. Eisenhower , the Republican Party presidential nominee in the 1952 election . Nixon served for eight years as vice president -- at 40 , the second-youngest vice president in history . He waged an unsuccessful presidential campaign in 1960 , narrowly losing to John F. Kennedy , and lost a race for Governor of California to Pat Brown in 1962 . In 1968 , he ran for the presidency again and was elected by defeating incumbent Vice President Hubert Humphrey .   Nixon ended American involvement in the war in Vietnam in 1973 and brought the American POWs home , and ended the military draft . Nixon 's visit to the People 's Republic of China in 1972 eventually led to diplomatic relations between the two nations , and he initiated d\u00e9tente and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union the same year . His administration generally transferred power from Washington D.C. to the states . He imposed wage and price controls for a period of ninety days , enforced desegregation of Southern schools and established the Environmental Protection Agency . Nixon also presided over the Apollo 11 moon landing , which signaled the end of the moon race . He was reelected in one of the largest electoral landslides in U.S. history in 1972 , when he defeated George McGovern .   The year 1973 saw an Arab oil embargo , gasoline rationing , and a continuing series of revelations about the Watergate scandal . The scandal escalated , costing Nixon much of his political support , and on August 9 , 1974 , he resigned in the face of almost certain impeachment and removal from office . After his resignation , he was issued a pardon by his successor , Gerald Ford . In retirement , Nixon 's work writing several books and undertaking of many foreign trips helped to rehabilitate his image . He suffered a debilitating stroke on April 18 , 1994 , and died four days later at the age of 81 .",

      "The Vandals were an East Germanic tribe , or group of tribes , who were first heard of in southern Poland , but later moved around Europe establishing kingdoms in Spain and later North Africa in the 5th century .   The Vandals are believed to have migrated from southern Scandinavia to the area between the lower Oder and Vistula rivers during the 2nd century BC and to have settled in Silesia from around 120 BC . They are associated with the Przeworsk culture and were possibly the same people as the Lugii . Expanding into Dacia during the Marcomannic Wars and to Pannonia during the Crisis of the Third Century , the Vandals were confined to Pannonia by the Goths around 330 AD , where they received permission to settle by Constantine the Great . Around 400 , raids by the Huns forced many of the Germanic tribes like the Goths to migrate to the Roman Empire , and fearing that they might be targeted next , the Vandals were pushed westwards crossing the Rhine into Gaul along with other tribes in 406 . In 409 , the Vandals crossed the Pyrenees into the Iberian Peninsula , where their main groups , the Hasdingi and the Silingi , settled in Gallaecia ( northwest ) and Baetica ( south central ) respectively .   After the Visigoths invaded Iberia , the Iranian Alans and Silingi Vandals voluntarily subjected to the rule of Hasdingian leader Gunderic , who was pushed from Gallaecia to Baetica by a Roman-Suebi coalition in 419 . In 429 , under king Genseric , the Vandals entered North Africa . By 439 they established a kingdom which included the Roman province of Africa as well as Sicily , Corsica , Sardinia , Malta and the Balearic Islands . They fended off several Roman attempts to recapture the African province , and sacked the city of Rome in 455 . Their kingdom collapsed in the Vandalic War of 533 -- 4 , in which Justinian I managed to reconquer the province for the Eastern Roman Empire .   Renaissance and Early Modern writers characterized the Vandals as barbarians , `` sacking and looting '' Rome . This led to the use of the term `` vandalism '' to describe any senseless destruction , particularly the `` barbarian '' defacing of artwork . However , modern historians tend to regard the Vandals during the transitional period from Late Antiquity to the Early Middle Ages as perpetuators , not destroyers , of Roman culture .",

Her two brothers disappeared , the `` Princes in the Tower '' , their fate unknown . She was welcomed back to court by her Uncle Richard III , along with all of her sisters . As a Yorkist princess , the final victory of the Lancastrian faction in the War of the Roses may have seemed a further disaster , but Henry Tudor knew the importance of Yorkist support for his invasion and promised to marry her before he arrived in England ; this was an important move , which , however , failed to bring him the desired Yorkist support .   Her marriage seems to have been successful , though her eldest son Arthur , Prince of Wales , died at age 15 in 1502 , and three other children died young .

Route 92 was also assigned in the 1953 renumbering and by the late 1950s it was named the Princeton -- Hightstown Bypass , a freeway planned to connect the Somerset Freeway ( an unbuilt section of Interstate 95 ) in Montgomery Township ( near Skillman ) , with Route 33 in East Windsor Township ( east of Hightstown ) .

      "A polygraphic substitution is a cipher in which a uniform substitution is performed on blocks of letters . When the length of the block is specifically known , more precise terms are used : for instance , a cipher in which pairs of letters are substituted is bigraphic .   As a concept , polygraphic substitution contrasts with monoalphabetic ( or simple ) substitutions in which individual letters are uniformly substituted , or polyalphabetic substitutions in which individual letters are substituted in different ways depending on their position in the text . In theory , there is some overlap in these definitions ; one could conceivably consider a Vigen\u00e8re cipher with an eight-letter key to be an octographic substitution . In practice , this is not a useful observation since it is far more fruitful to consider it to be a polyalphabetic substitution cipher .",

      "The Red Devil Sport Club is a mixed martial arts academy in St. Petersburg , Russia , founded by Vadim Finkelstein .   The team 's main fighter base is made up of Russian and Armenian Sambo fighters who have adapted their style to mixed martial arts , and they regularly compete in full contact combat sambo tournaments . Initially , Red Devil fighters were primarily stars of Finkelstien 's MMA promotion M-1 Global such as Ibragim Magomedov , Roman Zentsov , Amar Suloev , and Arman Gambaryan . Throughout the history of M-1 global , Red Devil has competed in team events , and have proven consistently to be among Russia 's best MMA teams .   Since 2005 the team 's most notable fighters are the brothers Fedor and Aleksander Emelianenko . The Emelianenko brothers left Russian Top Team due to claims of management abuse , and since that time the primary trainers for Red Devil have been the Emelianenkos ' childhood coaches Vladimir Voronov , and Aleksander Michkov . The membership and popularity of the team has increased since Fedor and Aleksander joined as well , primarily drawing from the ranks of Russia 's Combat Sambo competitors . Former champions such as Mikhail Zayats , Victor Nemkov , Aleksander Garkushenko , among others have been drawn to the club since the success of the Emelianenkos .   Because of Fedor 's previous association with the Russian Top Team , the two MMA associations maintained a cohabitant rivalry , until Russian Top Team was largely dissolved following the death of former manager Vladimir Pogonin , as well as the retirement of the team 's former featured coach and fighter Volk Han .   In 2009 Aleksander Emelianenko officially left the Red Devil for unexplained reasons , however he currently continues to train with his brothers Fedor , and Ivan , along with longtime coach Vladimir Voronin , Aleksander Michkov , and family friend Kirill Sidelnikov in Stary Oskol , Russia .   The team competed in the 2008 M-1 Challenge championship ( M-1 Challenge # 1 ) and won it . In 2009 it performed much worse failing to win its group in the M-1 Challenge 2009 , where it appeared under the name Imperial Team . This is thought to be largely due to the frequency in which Red Devil enters some of its most inexperienced members into the M-1 challenge events . The team also chose the name ` Imperial Team ' as its current feature fighter Fedor Emelianenko has reservations over the name ` Red Devil ' , and due to spiritual reasons prefers the name Imperial Team .",

That situation arises in the context of the Circular convolution theorem . The identical operation can also be expressed in terms of the periodic summations of both functions , if the infinite integration interval is reduced to just one period . That situation arises in the context of the discrete-time Fourier transform ( DTFT ) and is also called periodic convolution .

      "Indonesia is a source , transit , and destination country for women , children , and men trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor . The greatest threat of trafficking facing Indonesian men and women is that posed by conditions of forced labor and debt bondage in more developed Asian countries and the Middle East . The government stopped permitting Indonesian women to travel to Japan and South Korea as `` cultural performers , '' to curtail a practice that led to victims being trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation . However , in 2007 traffickers increasingly used false documents , including passports , to obtain tourist visas for women and girls who are subsequently forced into prostitution in Japan , through the unlawful exploitation of recruitment debts as high as $ 20,000 each . Trafficking of young girls to Taiwan as brides , mainly from West Kalimantan , persisted . Traffickers use false marriage licenses and other false documentation in order to obtain visas and subsequently force the women and girls into prostitution . Women from the People 's Republic of China , Thailand , and Eastern Europe are trafficked to Indonesia for commercial sexual exploitation , although the numbers are small compared with the number of Indonesians trafficked for this purpose . A significant number of Indonesian men and women who migrate overseas each year to work in the construction , agriculture , manufacturing , and domestic service sectors are subjected to conditions of forced labor or debt bondage in Malaysia , Saudi Arabia , Iraq , Singapore , Taiwan , Hong Kong , United Arab Emirates , Jordan , Kuwait , Qatar , Syria , France , Belgium , Germany , and the Netherlands . Malaysia and Saudi Arabia are the top destinations for legal and illegal Indonesian migrant workers who are trafficked for domestic servitude , commercial sexual exploitation , and forced labor . Some labor recruitment companies , known as PJTKIs , operated similarly to trafficking rings , luring both male and female workers into debt bondage , involuntary servitude , and other trafficking situations . Some workers , often women intending to migrate , entered trafficking and trafficking-like situations during their attempt to find work abroad through licensed and unlicensed PJTKIs . These labor recruiters charged workers high commission fees -- up to $ 3,000 -- which are not regulated under Indonesian law and often require workers to incur debt to pay , leaving them vulnerable in some instances to situations of debt bondage . PJTKIs also reportedly withheld the documents of some workers , and confined them in holding centers , sometimes for periods of many months . Some PJTKIs also used threats of violence to maintain control over prospective migrant workers . Recruitment agencies routinely falsified birth dates , including for children , in order to apply for passports and migrant worker documents . Internal trafficking is a significant problem in Indonesia with women and children exploited in domestic servitude , commercial sexual exploitation , rural agriculture , mining , fishing , and cottage industries . Women and girls are trafficked into commercial sexual exploitation in Malaysia , Singapore , and throughout Indonesia . Indonesians are recruited with offers of jobs in restaurants , factories , or as domestics and then forced into the sex trade . Young women and girls are trafficked throughout Indonesia and via the Riau Islands , Kalimantan , and Sulawesi to Malaysia and Singapore . Malaysians and Singaporeans constitute the largest number of sex tourists , and the Riau Islands and surrounding areas operate a `` prostitution economy , '' according to local officials . Sex tourism is rampant in most urban areas and tourist destinations . A 2006 bilateral MOU between the Indonesian and Malaysian governments , governing the employment of an estimated one million Indonesian domestic workers in Malaysia , failed to provide adequate protection to Indonesian migrant workers and explicitly endorsed a practice that is widely seen as a potential facilitator of forced labor -- the right of Malaysian employers to hold the passports of Indonesian workers . This agreement has not been amended to offer protections from forced labor conditions .   The Government of Indonesia does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking ; however , it is making significant efforts to do so . While the government made clear progress in bringing sex trafficking offenders to justice , in part through use of its new anti-trafficking law , a pronounced weakness shown was the failure to curb the large-scale trafficking practices of licensed and unlicensed Indonesian labor agencies . Indonesia has the region 's largest trafficking problem , with hundreds of thousands of trafficking victims , and has a largely unchecked problem of trafficking-related complicity by public officials .",

The primary preoccupation of his reign was the so-called `` Babylonian problem '' , the refusal of the Babylonians to accept Assyrian rule , culminating in his destruction of the city in 689 BCE . Further campaigns were carried out in Syria ( notable for being recorded in the Bible 's Books of Kings , ) in the mountains east of Assyria , against the kingdoms of Anatolia and against the Arabs in the northern Arabian deserts . His death was welcomed in Babylon as divine punishment for the destruction of that city .   He was also a notable builder : it was under him that Assyrian art reached its peak . His building projects included the beautification of Nineveh , a canal 50 km long to bring water to the city , and the `` Palace Without Rival '' , which included what may have been the prototype of the legendary Hanging Gardens of Babylon , or even the actual Hanging Gardens ."

      "Smart Power : Between Diplomacy and War , is a 2013 book written by Christian Whiton with a foreword by Paula Dobriansky . Both were diplomats in the George W. Bush administration .   The book is Whiton 's attempt to articulate a realistic defense strategy for major contemporary threats to U.S. national security , with an emphasis on using smart power , which he defines as `` the neglected tools of statecraft that lie between diplomacy and outright war . '' Whiton includes personal accounts from the Bush administration and critiques of foreign policy in the Obama administration to illustrate what he believes to be a lack of U.S. smart power acumen . Whiton also draws heavily from the Cold War and other points in history to illustrate successful smart power . He adapts these tools to current threats , which he argues are primarily composed of Iran , China , and Islamism . Whiton also addresses the politics of national security , critiquing prominent figures on both the political left and the right .   One reviewer summarized , `` He defines the essence of ` smart power ' as ` peacefully shaping political outcomes in foreign countries , ' a skill no recent presidency has mastered . ''",

      "RFA Sir Percivale ( L3036 ) was a Round Table class landing ship logistics . She originally entered British Army service in 1968 , managed for the Ministry of Transport by British India Steam Navigation Company , but was taken over by the Royal Fleet Auxiliary along with the other members of the class in 1970 . The first twelve years of the ship 's life were quiet , with some time spent in the Pacific , until the Falklands War broke out in April 1982 . Along with all the Navy 's other amphibious assault shipping , Sir Percivale went south to participate in the recapture of the Falkland Islands . She pioneered the supply runs to Teal Inlet and was the first British ship to re-enter Stanley Harbour . Unlike the Sir Galahad , Sir Tristram and Sir Lancelot , the ship emerged unscathed from the conflict .   The ship also served in the Gulf War in 1991 and twice deployed to the Adriatic to support British operations in the Balkans . In 1996 Sir Percivale took part in combined exercises with Jordan , followed by Green Wader 96 , the first exercise of the then newly formed Amphibious Squadron of the Joint Rapid Deployment Force . In 1997 , the ship took part in the large Ocean Wave 97 deployment to the far east and was present for the handover of Hong Kong to the Chinese . Following this ceremony , Sir Percivale escorted the ships of the former Hong Kong Squadron ( 3 Peacock class patrol vessel ) to their new owners in the Philippines . During other parts of Ocean Wave , the ship took Royal Marines to Brunei , Singapore and Thailand for various exercises . 1998 saw further exercises as Sir Percivale took part in practice amphibious assaults in Norway , France and Spain .   In 2000 , Sir Percivale was deployed to Sierra Leone to support British forces training the army of that country . In September 2000 , the ship was alongside in Freetown when British forces who had been taken hostage were rescued in a raid by the Parachute Regiment and the SAS ( `` Operation Barras '' ) . Since then the ship has been deployed during operations connected with Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003 .   The ship was to have a SLEP overhaul , but an equivalent overhaul of Sir Bedivere proved so costly that plans were abandoned and new ships were procured instead .   Sir Percivale was decommissioned on 17 August 2004 and was laid up alongside at Marchwood Military Port , Southampton . Sir Percivale remained at the Sea Mounting Centre ( SMC ) until 0058hrs , 13 December 2009 when she was towed to Liverpool for scrapping .",

      "Henry III ( 1 October 1207 -- 16 November 1272 ) , also known as Henry of Winchester , was King of England , Lord of Ireland and Duke of Aquitaine from 1216 until his death . The son of King John and Isabella of Angoul\u00eame , Henry assumed the throne when he was only nine in the middle of the First Barons ' War . Cardinal Guala declared the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade and Henry 's forces , led by William Marshal , defeated the rebels at the battles of Lincoln and Sandwich in 1217 . Henry promised to abide by the Great Charter of 1225 , which limited royal power and protected the rights of the major barons . His early rule was dominated first by Hubert de Burgh and then Peter des Roches , who re-established royal authority after the war . In 1230 the King attempted to reconquer the provinces of France that had once belonged to his father , but the invasion was a debacle . A revolt led by William Marshal 's son , Richard , broke out in 1232 , ending in a peace settlement negotiated by the Church .   Following the revolt , Henry ruled England personally , rather than governing through senior ministers . He travelled less than previous monarchs , investing heavily in a handful of his favourite palaces and castles . He married Eleanor of Provence , with whom he had five children . Henry was known for his piety , holding lavish religious ceremonies and giving generously to charities ; the King was particularly devoted to the figure of Edward the Confessor , whom he adopted as his patron saint . He extracted huge sums of money from the Jews in England , ultimately crippling their ability to do business , and as attitudes towards the Jews hardened , he introduced the Statute of Jewry , attempting to segregate the community . In a fresh attempt to reclaim his family 's lands in France , he invaded Poitou in 1242 , leading to the disastrous Battle of Taillebourg . After this , Henry relied on diplomacy , cultivating an alliance with Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II . Henry supported his brother Richard in his bid to become King of the Romans in 1256 , but was unable to place his own son Edmund on the throne of Sicily , despite investing large amounts of money . He planned to go on crusade to the Levant , but was prevented from doing so by rebellions in Gascony .   By 1258 , Henry 's rule was increasingly unpopular , the result of the failure of his expensive foreign policies and the notoriety of his Poitevin half-brothers , the Lusignans , as well as the role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts . A coalition of his barons , initially probably backed by Eleanor , seized power in a coup d'\u00e9tat and expelled the Poitevins from England , reforming the royal government through a process called the Provisions of Oxford . Henry and the baronial government enacted a peace with France in 1259 , under which Henry gave up his rights to his other lands in France in return for King Louis IX of France recognising him as the rightful ruler of Gascony . The baronial regime collapsed but Henry was unable to reform a stable government and instability across England continued .   In 1263 one of the more radical barons , Simon de Montfort , seized power , resulting in the Second Barons ' War . Henry persuaded Louis to support his cause and mobilised an army . The Battle of Lewes occurred in 1264 , where Henry was defeated and taken prisoner . Henry 's eldest son , Edward , escaped from captivity to defeat de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham the following year and freed his father . Henry initially enacted a harsh revenge on the remaining rebels , but was persuaded by the Church to mollify his policies through the Dictum of Kenilworth . Reconstruction was slow and Henry had to acquiesce to various measures , including further suppression of the Jews , to maintain baronial and popular support . Henry died in 1272 , leaving Edward as his successor . He was buried in Westminster Abbey , which he had rebuilt in the second half of his reign , and was moved to his current tomb in 1290 . Some miracles were declared after his death but he was not canonised .",

      "The Corsican wildcat ( Felis silvestris reyi ) is a subspecies of the wildcat found on the island of Corsica . The Corsican subspecies differs from the others in its dark fur , short tail , and lack of russet coloring behind the ears .   The subspecies was described by French zoologist L. Lavauden based on a skull and three skins collected in 1929 by a Corsican schoolteacher named Rey-Jouvin . Although Rey-Jouvin and other witnesses described the Corsican cat to be fairly common at the time , no other specimens have been collected since then , so the subspecies is possibly extinct .",
      "Henry III ( 19 September 1551 -- 2 August 1589 ; born Alexandre \u00c9douard de France , Henryk Walezy , Henrikas Valua ) was a monarch of the House of Valois who was elected the monarch of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from 1573 to 1575 and ruled as King of France from 1574 until his death . He was the last French monarch of the Valois dynasty .   As the fourth son of King Henry II of France and Catherine de ' Medici , Henry was not expected to assume the throne of France . He was thus a good candidate for the vacant Commonwealth throne , and he was elected with the dual titles King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania .   Henry 's rule over the Commonwealth was brief , but notable . The Henrician Articles he signed into law accepting the Commonwealth throne established Poland as an elective monarchy subject to free election by the Polish nobility . Of his three older brothers , two would live long enough to ascend the French throne , but both died young and without a legitimate male heir . He abandoned Commonwealth upon receiving word that he had inherited the throne of France at the age of 22 .   The kingdom of France was at the time plagued by the Wars of Religion , and Henry 's authority was undermined by violent political parties funded by foreign powers : the Catholic League ( supported by Spain ) , the Protestant Huguenots ( supported by England and the Dutch ) and the Malcontents , led by Henry 's own brother , the Duke of Alen\u00e7on , which was a party of Catholic and Protestant aristocrats who jointly opposed the absolutist ambitions of the king . Henry III was himself a politique , arguing that a strong and religiously tolerant monarchy would save France from collapse .   After the death of Henry 's younger brother Francis , Duke of Anjou , and when it became apparent that Henry would not produce an heir , the Wars of Religion grew into a succession crisis that resulted in a war known as the War of the Three Henrys . Henry III 's legitimate heir was his distant cousin Henry , King of Navarre , a Protestant . The Catholic League , led by Henry I , Duke of Guise , sought to exclude Protestants from the succession and championed the Catholic Charles , Cardinal of Bourbon , as Henry III 's heir .   In 1589 , Jacques Cl\u00e9ment , a Catholic fanatic , murdered Henry III , who was succeeded by the King of Navarre who , as Henry IV , would assume the throne of France after converting to Catholicism , and become the first French king of the House of Bourbon ."

      "Pedestrian zones ( also known as auto-free zones and car-free zones , and as pedestrian precincts in British English ) are areas of a city or town reserved for pedestrian-only use and in which most or all automobile traffic may be prohibited . Converting a street or an area to pedestrian-only use is called pedestrianisation . Pedestrianisation usually aims to provide better accessibility and mobility for pedestrians , to enhance the volume of shopping and other business activity in the area and/or to improve the attractiveness of the local environment in terms of aesthetics , air pollution , noise and accidents involving pedestrians . However , pedestrianisation can sometimes lead to reductions in business activity , property devaluation , and displacement of economic activity to other areas . In some cases traffic in surrounding areas may increase , due to displacement rather than substitution of car traffic . Nonetheless , pedestrianisation schemes are often associated with significant drops in local air and noise pollution , accidents , and frequently with increased retail turnover and increased property values locally . A car-free development generally implies a large scale pedestrianised area that relies on modes of transport other than the car , while pedestrian zones may vary in size from a single square to entire districts , but with highly variable degrees of dependence on cars for their broader transport links .   Pedestrian zones have a great variety of approaches to human-powered vehicles such as bicycles , inline skates , skateboards and kick scooters . Some have a total ban on anything with wheels , others ban certain categories , others segregate the human-powered wheels from foot traffic , and others still have no rules at all . Many Middle Eastern kasbahs have no wheeled traffic , but use donkey-driven or hand-driven carts for freight transport .",

Tennessee is the 36th largest and the 16th most populous of the 50 United States . Tennessee is bordered by Kentucky and Virginia to the north , North Carolina to the east , Georgia , Alabama , and Mississippi to the south , and Arkansas and Missouri to the west . The Appalachian Mountains dominate the eastern part of the state , and the Mississippi River forms the state 's western border . Nashville is the state 's largest city , with a population of 660,388 . Tennessee 's second largest city is Memphis , which has a population of 652,717 .   The state of Tennessee is rooted in the Watauga Association , a 1772 frontier pact generally regarded as the first constitutional government west of the Appalachians . What is now Tennessee was initially part of North Carolina , and later part of the Southwest Territory . Tennessee was admitted to the Union as the 16th state on June 1 , 1796 . Tennessee was the last state to leave the Union and join the Confederacy at the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 . Occupied by Union forces from 1862 , it was the first state to be readmitted to the Union at the end of the war .   Tennessee furnished more soldiers for the Confederate Army than any other state besides Virginia , and more soldiers for the Union Army than the rest of the Confederacy combined . Beginning during Reconstruction , it had competitive party politics , but a Democratic takeover in the late 1880s resulted in passage of disfranchisement laws that excluded most blacks and many poor whites from voting . This sharply reduced competition in politics in the state until after passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-20th century . In the 20th century , Tennessee transitioned from an agrarian economy to a more diversified economy , aided by massive federal investment in the Tennessee Valley Authority and , in the early 1940s , the city of Oak Ridge . This city was established to house the Manhattan Project 's uranium enrichment facilities , helping to build the world 's first atomic bomb , which was used during World War II .   Tennessee 's major industries include agriculture , manufacturing , and tourism . Poultry , soybeans , and cattle are the state 's primary agricultural products , and major manufacturing exports include chemicals , transportation equipment , and electrical equipment . The Great Smoky Mountains National Park , the nation 's most visited national park , is headquartered in the eastern part of the state , and a section of the Appalachian Trail roughly follows the Tennessee-North Carolina border . Other major tourist attractions include the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga ; Dollywood in Pigeon Forge ; Ripley 's Aquarium of the Smokies and Ober Gatlinburg in Gatlinburg ; the Parthenon , the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum , and Ryman Auditorium in Nashville ; the Jack Daniel 's Distillery in Lynchburg ; Elvis Presley 's Graceland residence and tomb , the Memphis Zoo , and the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis ; and Bristol Motor Speedway in Bristol .",

      "Toy Story 2 is a 1999 American computer-animated comedy adventure film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures . Directed by John Lasseter and co-directed by Lee Unkrich and Ash Brannon , it is the sequel to the 1995 film Toy Story .   In the film , Woody is stolen by a toy collector , prompting Buzz Lightyear and his friends to vow to rescue him , but Woody is then tempted by the idea of immortality in a museum . Many of the original characters and voices from Toy Story return for this sequel , and several new characters -- including Jessie ( voiced by Joan Cusack ) , Barbie ( voiced by Jodi Benson ) , Stinky Pete ( voiced by Kelsey Grammer ) and Mrs. Potato Head ( voiced by Estelle Harris ) -- are introduced . It was the last Toy Story film that starred Jim Varney as Slinky Dog before his death in 2000 .   Disney initially envisioned the film as a direct-to-video sequel . Toy Story 2 began production in a building separated from Pixar , on a small scale , as most of the main Pixar staff were busy working on A Bug 's Life ( 1998 ) . When story reels proved promising , Disney upgraded the film to theatrical release , but Pixar was unhappy with the film 's quality . Lasseter and the story team redeveloped the entire plot in one weekend . Although most Pixar features take years to develop , the established release date could not be moved and the production schedule for Toy Story 2 was compressed into nine months .   Despite production struggles , Toy Story 2 opened in November 1999 to wildly successful box office numbers , eventually grossing over $ 497 million , and received universal acclaim from critics . Toy Story 2 has been considered by critics to be one of few sequel films to outshine the original , and it continues to be featured frequently on lists of the greatest animated films ever made . The film has seen multiple home media releases and a theatrical 3-D re-release in 2009 , 10 years after its initial release .

      "Jefferson Finis Davis ( June 3 , 1808 -- December 6 , 1889 ) was an American politician who was a Democratic U.S. Representative and Senator from Mississippi , the 23rd U.S. Secretary of War , and the President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War . He took personal charge of the Confederate war plans but was unable to find a strategy to defeat the more populous and industrialized Union . His diplomatic efforts failed to gain recognition from any foreign country , and at home , the collapsing Confederate economy forced his government to print more and more paper money to cover the war 's expenses , leading to runaway inflation and devaluation of the Confederate dollar .   Davis was born in Kentucky to a moderately prosperous farmer , and grew up on his older brother Joseph 's large cotton plantations in Mississippi and Louisiana . Joseph Davis also secured his appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point . After graduating , Jefferson Davis served six years as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army . He fought in the Mexican -- American War ( 1846 -- 1848 ) , as the colonel of a volunteer regiment . He served as the U.S. Secretary of War from 1853 to 1857 under President Franklin Pierce , and as a Democratic U.S. senator from Mississippi . Before the war , he operated a large cotton plantation in Mississippi but never owned more than 74 slaves . After the war had ended , he remained a proud apologist for the cause of slavery for which he and the Confederacy had fought . Although Davis argued against secession in 1858 , he believed that each state was sovereign and had an unquestionable right to secede from the Union .   Davis 's first wife , Sarah Knox Taylor , died of malaria after three months of marriage , and he also struggled with recurring bouts of the disease . He was unhealthy for much of his life . At the age of 36 , Davis married again , to 18-year-old Varina Howell , a native of Natchez who had been educated in Philadelphia and had some family ties in the North . They had six children . Only two survived him , and only one married and had children .   Many historians attribute the Confederacy 's weaknesses to the poor leadership of President Davis . His preoccupation with detail , reluctance to delegate responsibility , lack of popular appeal , feuds with powerful state governors and generals , favoritism toward old friends , inability to get along with people who disagreed with him , neglect of civil matters in favor of military ones , and resistance to public opinion all worked against him . Historians agree he was a much less effective war leader than his Union counterpart Abraham Lincoln . After Davis was captured in 1865 , he was accused of treason and imprisoned at Fort Monroe . He was never tried and was released after two years . While not disgraced , Davis had been displaced in ex-Confederate affection after the war by his leading general , Robert E. Lee . Davis wrote a memoir entitled The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government , which he completed in 1881 . By the late 1880s , he began to encourage reconciliation , telling Southerners to be loyal to the Union . Ex-Confederates came to appreciate his role in the war , seeing him as a Southern patriot , and he became a hero of the Lost Cause in the post-Reconstruction South .",

      "Ricardo A. M. R. Reis ( born September 1 , 1978 ) is a Portuguese economist and professor of economics at London School of Economics . Prior to that he was professor of economics at Columbia University where he became a full professor at the age of 29 , one of the youngest ever in the history of the university . He is the editor of the Journal of Monetary Economics and sits on the Board of Editors of the American Economic Review and the Journal of Economic Literature . He is an academic advisor and visiting scholar at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis , the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond .   Reis earned his Bachelor of Science ( B.Sc . ) degree from the London School of Economics in 1999 , and his Doctor of Philosophy ( Ph.D. ) from Harvard University in 2004 . He taught at Princeton University from 2004 to 2008 before moving to Columbia . In 2009 , Reis was ranked the second most cited young economist in the world . In a 2013 ranking of young economists by Glenn Ellison , Reis was considered the top economist with a PhD between 1996 and 2004 , ahead of Esther Duflo and Enrico Moretti .   Reis 's primary area of research is macroeconomics . His main theoretical contribution is the sticky-information Phillips curve together with associated theories of inattention , models of sticky information , and endogenous disagreement . In particular , in a 2002 article published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics , Reis and Gregory Mankiw proposed an alternative to the widely used New Keynesian Phillips curve , based on the slow diffusion of information among the population of price setters . Their sticky-information Phillips curve displays three related properties that are more consistent with accepted views about the effects of monetary policy . First , disinflations are always contractionary ( although announced disinflations are less contractionary than surprise ones ) . Second , monetary policy shocks have their maximum impact on inflation with a substantial delay . Third , the change in inflation is positively correlated with the level of economic activity . This article is Reis 's most cited work : According to Google Scholar , it has been cited more than 2000 times , while the RePEc citation count ranks it as one of the 300 most cited articles in the field of economics .   Reis 's work on monetary policy has included proposing measures of pure inflation , showing when a central bank can go insolvent and stating principles of central bank design . His work on fiscal policy has focused on targeted fiscal transfers . and the role of automatic stabilizers . He also participated on debates over the Euro crisis , proposing an explanation for the crisis and designing European Safe Bonds .   He writes for the Portuguese newspaper Jornal de Noticias and participates frequently in economic debates in Portugal .",

      "Military deception refers to attempts to mislead enemy forces during warfare .

As a form of strategic use of information ( disinformation ) , it overlaps with psychological warfare . To the degree that any enemy that falls for the deception will lose confidence when it is revealed , he may hesitate when confronted with the truth .   Deception in warfare dates back to early history . The Art of War , an ancient Chinese military treatise , puts great emphasis on the tactic . In modern times military deception has developed as a fully fledged doctrine . Misinformation and visual deception were employed during World War I and came into even greater prominence during World War II . In the buildup to the 1944 invasion of Normandy the Allies executed one of the largest deceptions in military history , Operation Bodyguard , helping them achieve full tactical surprise ."

Launched at the 1928 London Motor Show when the sales of the larger MG saloons was faltering because of the economic climate , the small car brought MG ownership to a new sector of the market and probably saved the company . Early cars were made in the Cowley factory , but from 1930 production had transferred to Abingdon .   The M-Type was one of the first genuinely affordable sports cars to be offered by an established manufacturer , as opposed to modified versions of factory-built saloon cars and tourers . By offering a car with excellent road manners and an entertaining driving experience at a low price ( the new MG cost less than double the cheapest version of the Morris Minor on which it was based ) despite relatively low overall performance the M-type set the template for many of the MG products that were to follow , as well as many of the other famous British sports cars of the 20th century . The M-type was also the first MG to wear the Midget name that would be used on a succession of small sports cars until 1980 .   This 2-door sports car used an updated version of the four-cylinder bevel-gear driven overhead camshaft engine used in the 1928 Morris Minor and Wolseley 10 with a single SU carburettor giving 20 bhp at 4000 rpm . < Drive was to the rear wheels through a three-speed non-synchromesh gearbox . The chassis was based on the one used in the 1928 Morris Minor with lowered suspension using half-elliptic springs and Hartford friction disk shock absorbers with rigid front and rear axles and bolt on wire wheels . The car had a wheelbase of 78 inches ( 1980 mm ) and a track of 42 inches ( 1067 mm ) .   1930 brought a series of improvements to the car . The Morris rod brake system , with the handbrake working on the transmission , was replaced a cable system with cross shaft coupled to the handbrake and the transmission brake deleted . Engine output was increased to 27 bhp by improving the camshaft and a four-speed gearbox was offered as an option . The doors became front-hinged . A supercharged version could be ordered from 1932 , raising the top speed to 80 mi/h .   Early bodies were fabric-covered using a wood frame ; this changed to all-metal in 1931 . Most cars had bodies made by Carbodies of Coventry and fitted by MG in either open two-seat or closed two-door `` Sportsmans '' coup\u00e9 versions , but some chassis were supplied to external coachbuilders such as Jarvis . The factory even made a van version as a service vehicle . The car could reach 65 mph ( 105 km/h ) and return 40 miles per gallon . The open version cost # 175 at launch , soon rising to # 185 , and the coup\u00e9 cost # 245 . The 1932 supercharged car cost # 250 .   The M-type had considerable sporting success , both privately and with official teams winning gold medals in the 1929 Land 's End Trial and class wins in the 1930 `` Double Twelve '' race at Brooklands . An entry was also made in the 1930 Le Mans 24 hour , but neither of the two cars finished .",

      "A waqf also known as habous or mortmain property , is an inalienable charitable endowment under Islamic law , which typically involves donating a building , plot of land or other assets for Muslim religious or charitable purposes with no intention of reclaiming the assets . The donated assets may be held by a charitable trust . The person making such dedication is known as waqif , a donor . In Ottoman Turkish law , and later under the British Mandate of Palestine , the waqf was defined as usufruct State land ( or property ) of which the State revenues are assured to pious foundations . Although based on several hadiths and presenting elements similar to practices from pre-Islamic cultures , it seems that the specific full-fledged Islamic legal form of endowment called waqf dates from the 9th century CE ( see paragraph `` History and location '' ) .",

      "ChristianityFrom Ancient Greek \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 , Khrist\u00f3s ( Latinized as Christus ) , translating Hebrew \u05de\u05b8\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05d7\u05b7 , M\u0101\u0161\u00ee\u0103\u1e25 , meaning `` the anointed one '' , with the Latin suffixes - ian and - itas . is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ , who serves as the focal point for the religion . It is the world 's largest religion , with over 2.4 billion followers , or 33 % of the global population , known as Christians . Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah ( the Christ ) was prophesied in the Old Testament .   Christian theology is summarized in creeds such as the Apostles ' Creed and Nicene Creed . These professions of faith state that Jesus suffered , died , was buried , descended into hell , and rose from the dead , in order to grant eternal life to those who believe in him and trust in him for the remission of their sins . The creeds further maintain that Jesus bodily ascended into heaven , where he reigns with God the Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit , and that he will return to judge the living and the dead and grant eternal life to his followers . His incarnation , earthly ministry , crucifixion and resurrection are often referred to as `` the gospel '' , meaning `` good news '' . `` Good news '' is a translation of the Ancient Greek term \u03b5\u1f50\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd euang\u00e9lion , from which the terms evangelical and evangelism derive . The term gospel also refers to written accounts of Jesus 's life and teaching , four of which -- Matthew , Mark , Luke and John -- are considered canonical and included in the Christian Bible .   Christianity is an Abrahamic religion that began as a Second Temple Judaic sect in the mid-1st century . Originating in Judea , it quickly spread to Europe , Syria , Mesopotamia , Asia Minor , Transcaucasia , Egypt , Ethiopia and India , and by the end of the 4th century had become the official state church of the Roman Empire . Following the Age of Discovery , Christianity spread to the Americas , Australasia , sub-Saharan Africa and the rest of the world through missionary work and colonization . Christianity has played a prominent role in the shaping of Western civilization .   Throughout its history , Christianity has weathered schisms and theological disputes that have resulted in many distinct churches and denominations . Worldwide , the three largest branches of Christianity are the Catholic Church , the Eastern Orthodox Church and the various denominations of Protestantism . The Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches broke communion with each other in the East -- West Schism of 1054 ; Protestantism came into existence in the Reformation of the 16th century , splitting from the Catholic Church .",
      "The New Testament or NT ( \u1f29 \u039a\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u1f74 , H\u0113 Kain\u1e15 Diath\u1e17k\u0113 ; Novum Testamentum ) is the second major part of the Christian biblical canon , the first part being the Old Testament , based on the Hebrew Bible . The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of Jesus , as well as events in first-century Christianity . Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as sacred scripture . The New Testament ( in whole or in part ) has frequently accompanied the spread of Christianity around the world . It reflects and serves as a source for Christian theology and morality . Both extended readings and phrases directly from the New Testament are also incorporated ( along with readings from the Old Testament ) into the various Christian liturgies . The New Testament has influenced religious , philosophical , and political movements in Christendom and left an indelible mark on literature , art , and music .   The New Testament is a collection of Christian works written in the common ( Koine ) Greek language of the first century , at different times by various writers , who were early Jewish followers of Jesus , and the modern consensus is that it also provides important evidence regarding Judaism in the first century AD . In almost all Christian traditions today , the New Testament consists of 27 books . The original texts were written in the first and perhaps the second centuries of the Christian Era , in Greek , which was the common language of the Eastern Mediterranean from the Conquests of Alexander the Great ( 335 -- 323 BC ) until the Muslim conquests in the 7th century AD . All the works that eventually became incorporated into the New Testament are believed to have been written no later than around 150 AD , and a small minority of scholars would date them to no later than 70 AD . John A. T. Robinson , Dan Wallace , and William F. Albright dated all the books of the New Testament before 70 AD . Others give a final date of 80 AD , or at 96 AD .   Collections of related texts such as letters of the Apostle Paul ( a major collection of which must have been made already by the early 2nd century ) and the Canonical Gospels of Matthew , Mark , Luke , and John ( asserted by Irenaeus of Lyon in the late-2nd century as the Four Gospels ) gradually were joined to other collections and single works in different combinations to form various Christian canons of Scripture . Over time , some disputed books , such as the Book of Revelation and the Minor Catholic ( General ) Epistles were introduced into canons in which they were originally absent . Other works earlier held to be Scripture , such as 1 Clement , the Shepherd of Hermas , and the Diatessaron , were excluded from the New Testament . The Old Testament canon is not completely uniform among all major Christian groups including Roman Catholics , Protestants , the Greek Orthodox Church , the Slavic Orthodox Churches , and the Armenian Orthodox Church . However , the twenty-seven-book canon of the New Testament , at least since Late Antiquity , has been almost universally recognized within Christianity ( see Development of the New Testament canon ) .   The New Testament consists of :  Four narratives of the life , teaching , death and resurrection of Jesus called `` gospel '' or the good news .  A narrative of the Apostle ministries in the early church , called the `` Acts of the Apostles '' , and probably written by the same writer as the Gospel of Luke , which it continues ;  Twenty-one letters , often called `` epistles '' from Greek `` epistole '' , written by various authors , and consisting of Christian doctrine , counsel , instruction , and conflict resolution ; and  An Apocalypse , the Book of Revelation , which is a book of prophecy , containing some instructions to seven local congregations of Asia Minor , but mostly containing prophetical symbology , about the end times .",
      "A condolence book or book of condolence is a book in which people may record their condolences after a death or great tragedy .   After the death of a leading figure or great disaster , condolence books are placed in public places for members of the general public to use . When closed , the books are given to the relatives of the deceased or archived . Reviewing a condolence book may help grieving relatives come to terms with the reality of their loss .   After especially notable deaths , official records of the condolences may be compiled and reprinted . For example , after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln , the Government Printing Office published a leather-bound , gilt-edged collection of official condolences in 1867 .   Digital condolence books are now placed on the Internet so people may write their thoughts on-line ."

      "Narga Selassie is an Orthodox church on the western shores of Dek Island , the largest island of Lake Tana in northern Ethiopia . The name signifies `` Trinity of the Rest '' . `` Rest '' refers to the place and the shade thereabouts .   The church was constructed by Empress Mentewab in the late 18th century , apparently using as construction material for doors and roof a gigantic sycamore fig tree that stood at the centre of a slight elevation , now the centre of the church . Narga Selassie is fully decorated in the local style . A relief on the main entry portrays the Scottish explorer James Bruce , who visited the capital , Gondar , in the late 19th century .   Narga Selassie was constructed in the classic round architectural tradition of the churches in the Lake Tana area , with the usage of stone both in the perinaeum around the church and in the compound walls .   The church is accessed from the lake through a port constructed in 1987 , which is connected to Bahir Dar and Gorgora by a state-owned ferry service . The access is in itself a beauty spot with a huge sycamore with long aerial roots descending to the lake and a door tower which forms part of the original construction .",

The merger was achieved by expanding the preceding Syrian Islamic Front alliance . The group is widely seen as backed and armed by Saudi Arabia .   On 24 December 2014 , the Islamic Front factions in the Aleppo Governorate formed the Levant Front alliance with other armed groups in northern Syria .

Her husband was the state 's founding emperor , Murong Chui ( Emperor Wucheng ) . Her given name is lost to history , but her courtesy name Yuanfei was recorded . She was the niece of two of Murong Chui 's prior wives , who were daughters of the Xianbei chief Duan Mopei . Her father Duan Yi was a brother of the Princesses Duan .

Large Georgian communities are also present throughout Russia , Turkey , Greece , Iran , Ukraine , United States , and to a lesser extent throughout the European Union .   Georgians arose from the ancient Colchian and Iberian civilizations . After Christianization of Iberia by Saint Nino they became one of the first who embraced the faith of Jesus in the early 4th century and now the majority of Georgians are Eastern Orthodox Christians and most follow their national autocephalous Georgian Orthodox Church . There are also small Georgian Catholic and Muslim communities in Tbilisi and Adjara , as well as a significant number of irreligious Georgians .   A complex process of nation formation has resulted in a diverse set of geographic subgroups of Georgians , each with its characteristic traditions , manners , dialects and , in the case of Svans and Mingrelians , own regional languages . The Georgian language , with its own unique writing system and extensive written tradition , which goes back to the 5th century , is the official language of Georgia as well as the language of education of all Georgians living in the country .   Located on the crossroads of predominantly Christian Europe and Muslim Western Asia , Georgian people have maintained their Christian identity in the face of great pressure from neighboring Muslim empires . By the early 11th century they formed a unified Kingdom of Georgia and inaugurated the Georgian Golden Age , a height of political and cultural power of the nation . This lasted until being weakened by Mongol invasions , as well as internal divisions following the death of George V the Brilliant , the last of the great kings of Georgia . Thereafter and throughout the early modern period Georgians became politically fractured and fell into decline due to the onslaught of various hostile empires , including the Ottoman Empire and successive dynasties of Persia . To ensure Georgia 's survival , in 1783 Heraclius II of Georgia forged an alliance with the Russian Empire , which Georgians viewed as a replacement for their fallen traditional ally -- Byzantine Empire . The Russo-Georgian alliance , however , backfired as Russia was unwilling to fulfill the terms of the treaty , proceeding to annex the troubled kingdom in 1801 . Georgians briefly reasserted their independence from Russia under the First Georgian Republic from 1918-1921 , and finally , in 1991 from the Soviet Union .",

      "Colchis ( -LSB- \u02c8k\u0252lk\u026as -RSB- \u10d9\u10dd\u10da\u10ee\u10d4\u10d7\u10d8 Kolkheti ; Greek \u039a\u03bf\u03bb\u03c7\u03af\u03c2 Kolkhis ) was an ancient kingdom and region on the coast of the Black Sea , centered in present-day western Georgia . It has been described in modern scholarship as `` the earliest Georgian formation '' which , along with the Kingdom of Iberia , would later contribute significantly to the development of the medieval Georgian statehood and the Georgian nation . Internationally , Colchis is perhaps best known for its role in Greek mythology , most notably as the destination of the Argonauts , as well as the home to Medea and the Golden fleece . It was also described as a land rich with gold , iron , timber and honey that would export it 's resources mostly to ancient Greece .   Colchis was populated by Colchians , an early Kartvelian-speaking tribe , ancestral to the contemporary Western Georgians , namely Svans and Mingrelians , as well as the related Lazs . Its geography is mostly assigned to what is now the western part of Georgia and encompasses the present-day Georgian provinces of Samegrelo , Imereti , Guria , Adjara , Abkhazeti , Svaneti , Racha ; modern Russia 's Sochi and Tuapse districts ; and present-day Turkey 's Rize , Trabzon and Artvin provinces .",
      "In Greco-Roman geography , Iberia ( Ancient Greek : \u1f38\u03b2\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 Hiberia ) was an exonymic name for a Georgian kingdom of Kartli , known after its core province , which during Classical Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages was a significant monarchy in the Caucasus , either as an independent state or as a dependent of larger empires , notably the Sassanid and Roman empires . Iberia , centered on present-day Eastern Georgia , was bordered by Colchis in the west , Caucasian Albania in the east and Armenia in the south .   Its population , the Iberians , formed the nucleus of the Georgians ( Kartvelians ) . Iberia , ruled by Pharnavazid , Arsacid and Chosroid royal dynasties , together with Colchis to its west , would form the nucleus of the unified medieval Kingdom of Georgia under Bagrationi dynasty .   In the 4th century , after Christianization of Iberia by Saint Nino during the reign of King Mirian III Christiantity was made the state religion of the kingdom . Starting in the early 6th century AD , the kingdom 's position as a Sassanian vassal state was changed into effectively direct Persian rule . In 580 , king Hormizd IV ( 578-590 ) abolished the monarchy after the death of King Bakur III , and Iberia became a Persian province ruled by a marzpan ( governor ) .   The term `` Caucasian Iberia '' is also being used to distinguish it from the Iberian Peninsula in Western Europe .",

After completing his studies , Berglin has been living in G\u00e4vle where he works as a teacher of Swedish and religion . He published his early strips in the local social democratic newspaper Arbetarbladet , but became known to a wider audience in 1995 , when he started to draw for the Stockholm-based but nationally distributed conservative newspaper Svenska Dagbladet . His strips have been collected and republished in several albums .   Berglin 's strips , usually in four panels , tend to find their humour in a sometimes absurd mix of everyday situations and literary and philosophical references or reflections . When he was awarded the Alf Henrikson Prize in 2004 , the jury 's motivation spoke of his renditions of the `` existence of the everyday human between ideals and matter '' .   In later years Berglin has acknowledged the input of his wife Maria Berglin , an artist and literary critic , within his strips by signing them `` Berglins '' .",

      "The Sands Hotel and Casino was a historic hotel and casino on the Las Vegas Strip in Nevada , United States , that operated from 1952 to 1996 . Designed by the architect Wayne McAllister , with a prominent 56 ft high sign , the Sands was the seventh resort to open on the Strip . During its heyday , the Sands was the center of entertainment and `` cool '' on the Strip , and hosted many famous entertainers of the day , most notably the Rat Pack .   The hotel was established in 1952 by Texan oil tycoon Jake Freedman , who bought up the LaRue Restaurant , which had opened two years earlier . The hotel was opened on December 15 , 1952 as a casino with 200 rooms , and was established less than three months after the opening of another notable landmark , Sahara Hotel and Casino . The hotel rooms were divided into four two-story motel wings , each with fifty rooms , and named after famous race tracks . The opening was widely publicized , and every guest was given a Chamois bag with silver dollars . Crime bosses such as Meyer Lansky and Frank Costello acquired shares in the hotel and attracted Frank Sinatra , who made his performing debut at Sands in October 1953 . Sinatra later bought a share in the hotel himself . Sinatra and Sammy Davis , Jr. were instrumental throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s in bringing a change in racial policy in Sands , and after an incident in 1961 , it began employing blacks . In 1960 the classic caper film Ocean 's 11 was shot at the hotel , and it subsequently attained iconic status , with regular performances by Sinatra , Dean Martin , Sammy Davis . Jr. , Red Skelton and others , who performed regularly in the hotel 's world-renowned Copa Room . Much of the musical success of the Copa Room is credited to the room 's band leader and musical conductor Antonio Morelli , whose house orchestra performed in the recording of hundreds of albums over the years .   In the mid 1960s , Sands and its adjacent properties were bought by the reclusive businessman Howard Hughes , who built a 500-room tower and modernized the hotel . After the 1970s it fell into decline until its final owner , Sheldon Adelson , made the decision to shut it down and to build a brand new resort . The last dice in the casino was rolled by Bob Stupak just after 6pm on June 30 , 1996 . On November 26 of that year , it was finally imploded and demolished , much to the dismay of longtime employees and sentimentalists . Today , The Venetian stands where the Sands once stood .",

It is located west of the Italian Peninsula , southeast of the French mainland , and north of the Italian island of Sardinia . A single chain of mountains makes up two-thirds of the island .   While being part of France , Corsica is also designated as a territorial collectivity ( collectivit\u00e9 territoriale ) by law . As a territorial collectivity , Corsica enjoys a greater degree of autonomy than other French regions ; for example , the Corsican Assembly is able to exercise limited executive powers .   The island formed a single department until it was split in 1975 into two departments : Haute-Corse ( Upper Corsica ) and Corse-du-Sud ( Southern Corsica ) , with its regional capital in Ajaccio , the prefecture city of Corse-du-Sud . Bastia , the prefecture city of Haute-Corse , is the second-largest settlement in Corsica .   After being ruled by the Republic of Genoa since 1284 , Corsica was briefly an independent Corsican Republic from 1755 until it was conquered by France in 1769 . Due to Corsica 's historical ties with the Italian peninsula , the island retains to this day many elements of the culture of Italy . The native Corsican language , whose northern variant is closely related to the Italian language , is recognised as a regional language by the French government . This Mediterranean island was ruled by various nations over the course of history but had several brief periods of independence .   Napoleon was born in 1769 in the Corsican capital of Ajaccio .

      "The British Rail Corporate Identity Manual is a corporate identity guide created in 1965 by British Rail . It was conceived in 1964 , and finished in July 1965 by British Rail 's Design Research Unit , and introduced British Rail 's enduring `` double arrow '' logo , created by Gerald Barney and still in use today as the logo for National Rail . The manual spanned four volumes , and was created as part of a comprehensive redesign of British Rail following the Beeching Cuts as part of a plan to attract more passengers . It is noted as a piece of British design history .   The first volume , published in July 1965 , introduced Rail Blue , a standardised colour for use of rolling stock liveries and the total adoption of Rail Alphabet , a typeface designed by Jock Kinneir and Margaret Calvert , for use across the British Rail network . It was exhibited at the Design Council , London in the same year . The second volume was published in November 1966 , contained guidance on printed publicity such as posters and regional logos . The third and fourth volumes , issued in 1970 , focused on the non-rail sectors of British Rail , including architecture , and new branding for Sealink .   In 2016 , the manual raised # 55,102 for a reprint , combining the four volumes into one book .",
      "A thunderstorm , also known as an electrical storm , lightning storm , or thundershower , is a storm characterized by the presence of lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth 's atmosphere , known as thunder . Thunderstorms occur in association with a type of cloud known as a cumulonimbus . They are usually accompanied by strong winds , heavy rain , and sometimes snow , sleet , hail , or , in contrast , no precipitation at all . Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband , known as a squall line . Strong or severe thunderstorms , known as supercells , rotate as do cyclones . While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy , vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction .   Thunderstorms result from the rapid upward movement of warm , moist air , sometimes along a front . As the warm , moist air moves upward , it cools , condenses , and forms a cumulonimbus cloud that can reach heights of over 20 km . As the rising air reaches its dew point temperature , water vapor condenses into water droplets or ice , reducing pressure locally within the thunderstorm cell . Any precipitation falls the long distance through the clouds towards the Earth 's surface . As the droplets fall , they collide with other droplets and become larger . The falling droplets create a downdraft as it pulls cold air with it , and this cold air spreads out at the Earth 's surface , occasionally causing strong winds that are commonly associated with thunderstorms .   Thunderstorms can form and develop in any geographic location but most frequently within the mid-latitude , where warm , moist air from tropical latitudes collides with cooler air from polar latitudes . Thunderstorms are responsible for the development and formation of many severe weather phenomena . Thunderstorms , and the phenomena that occur along with them , pose great hazards . Damage that results from thunderstorms is mainly inflicted by downburst winds , large hailstones , and flash flooding caused by heavy precipitation . Stronger thunderstorm cells are capable of producing tornadoes and waterspouts .   There are four types of thunderstorms : single-cell , multi-cell cluster , multi-cell lines , and supercells . Supercell thunderstorms are the strongest and the most associated with severe weather phenomena . Mesoscale convective systems formed by favorable vertical wind shear within the tropics and subtropics can be responsible for the development of hurricanes . Dry thunderstorms , with no precipitation , can cause the outbreak of wildfires from the heat generated from the cloud-to-ground lightning that accompanies them . Several means are used to study thunderstorms : weather radar , weather stations , and video photography . Past civilizations held various myths concerning thunderstorms and their development as late as the 18th century . Beyond the Earth 's atmosphere , thunderstorms have also been observed on the planets of Jupiter , Saturn , Neptune , and , probably , Venus .",
      "Stojan Cerovi\u0107 ( 9 July 1949 in Titograd , PR Montenegro , FPR Yugoslavia -- 21 March 2005 in Paris , France ) was a Serbian journalist .   Graduating in the University of Belgrade in psychology ( 1973 ) , Cerovi\u0107 made a name for himself as an uncompromising political critic for the independent weekly magazine Vreme . He often discussed his ambivalent feelings towards both the government and the opposition , particularly with a long-time friend Eric Gordy , who is associated with the Collegium Budapest-Institute for Advanced Study ( Hungary ) and author of `` Culture of Power in Serbia '' :   `` As far as I am concerned , I do not care much for any of the opposition parties , not even for all of them together . I have nothing against the regime , except that I consider it responsible for the war , the sanctions , for poverty , theft , crime , and the strangling of the free press . It does not seem to me that anybody in the opposition would be any better , only less effective , which is an advantage . It also seems to me that it is too late to hope for any great improvement in the quality of life , whoever may come into power . '' ( Na\u010delo Otrovanja , Vreme , No. 222 , 23 January 1995 , p. 8 ) .   Cerovi\u0107 's early professional life was spent opposing Tito in his post-graduate years , the 1970s , then Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and his opposition . He had twice evaded the draft . In 1992 , during the wake of the war with Croatia , Cerovi\u0107 co-founded the Centre for Anti-War Action in Belgrade and refused induction into the armed forces , calling on his peers to do likewise in a widely-broadcast radio interview . For weeks Cerovi\u0107 was forced to lay low in Montenegro , but returned to Belgrade when things simmered down and resumed writing his column lambasting Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and his cronies who were still in power .   In March 1999 , a week before NATO began its 77-day bombing spree of Yugoslavia , Milo\u0161evi\u0107 censored Vreme , which until then was free to criticize the government . Cerovi\u0107 was called upon to join the military . Once again he refused to be conscripted , but this time he had to flee the country . In April ( 1999 ) he drove to Sarajevo with his wife and children and from there boarded a plane for Hungary . In Budapest his family was provided with accommodations and given the red carpet treatment by the Hungarian government , a privilege no other Serbian draft dodger and his family was ever accorded with such deference . There Cerovi\u0107 was asked to join an Anglo-American sponsored shadowy government-in-exile , which he refused . In 2000 , from January to November , he was employed by the United States Institute of Peace , a U.S. Congress sponsored organization , as a Senior fellow with Special Project Focus . Other demands were made on Cerovi\u0107 and soon Budapest 's hospitality soured . The next few years he lived in a Paris apartment with his wife and three children before he died of cancer in 2005 .   He is the author of `` Bahanalija '' , published by Vreme , 1993 .   He once remarked : `` The boundaries between real and surreal -LSB- were -RSB- erased a long time ago . '' Cerovi\u0107 who expressed this paradox succinctly many times and on many occasions , appeared as a quote in P. H. Liotta 's book `` Dismembering the State : The death of Yugoslavia and Why It Matters . ''",

      "Team Fortress 2 ( TF2 ) is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed and published by Valve Corporation . It is the sequel to Team Fortress , the 1996 mod for Quake and its 1999 remake , Team Fortress Classic . It was released as part of the video game bundle The Orange Box in October 2007 for Microsoft Windows and the Xbox 360 . A PlayStation 3 version followed in December 2007 . The game was released for Windows as a standalone entry in April 2008 , and was updated to support OS X in June 2010 and Linux in February 2013 . It is distributed online through Valve 's digital retailer Steam , with retail distribution being handled by Electronic Arts .   In Team Fortress 2 , players join one of two teams comprising nine character classes , battling in a variety of game modes including capture the flag and king of the hill . The development is led by John Cook and Robin Walker , creators of the original Team Fortress . Announced in 1998 , the game once had more realistic , militaristic visuals and gameplay , but this changed over the protracted nine-year development . After Valve released no information for six years , Team Fortress 2 regularly featured in Wired News annual vaporware list among other ignominies . The finished Team Fortress 2 has cartoon-like visuals influenced by the art of J. C. Leyendecker , Dean Cornwell , and Norman Rockwell , and uses Valve 's Source game engine .   Team Fortress 2 received critical acclaim for its art direction , gameplay , humor , and use of character in a multiplayer-only game . Valve continues to release new content , including maps , items and game modes , as well as community-made updates and contributed content . In June 2011 , it became free-to-play , supported by microtransactions for in-game cosmetics . A ` drop system ' was also added and refined , allowing free-to-play users to periodically receive game equipment and items by use of a random number generator . Though the game had a unofficial competitive scene for many years , support for official competitive play through ranked matchmaking and an overhauled casual experience was added in July 2016 .",
      "The Derby della Mole , is the local derby , played out between Turin 's most prominent football clubs Juventus and Torino . It is also known as the Derby di Torino or the Turin Derby in English . It is named after the Mole Antonelliana , a major landmark in the city and the architectural symbol of the Piedmontese capital . It is the first derby of Italian football and the oldest meeting between two teams based in the same city still disputed .   The match between the two clubs represented until the First World War the juxtaposition of two opposing social classes . Juventus , founded in 1897 by students of a prestigious high school in Turin , soon became akin to the bourgeois in the town especially after enduring bond with the Agnelli family , which began in 1923 , during which time they were also supported by the aristocracy of the region . Torino instead was born in 1906 from a division within Juventus , at the hands of dissidents who joined forces with another team from the city , Football Club Torinese , who identified with the then early industrial world . In the sixties and seventies of the twentieth century , these differences had eased considerably , partly as a result of the great migration to Turin about forty years earlier , but did not disappear : Juventus lost much of its parochial connotations to become a global sports phenomenon , with a support detached from social classes and worldwide support , conversely , Torino became a symbol of one of the two citizen 's spirit .   The colours of the two teams also contribute , in small part , to this distinction : the Bianconeri , originally pink and black , adopted their jerseys from Notts County all the way from England , while the Granata dusted off the colours of the `` Brigade Savoia '' , that two centuries earlier had liberated the then capital of the Duchy of Savoy . Both clubs , however , feature within their emblems a raging bull , taken from the city 's coat of arms : Juventus as a bond with their origins , while Torino adopted it as their identity .",

      "The giant anteater ( Myrmecophaga tridactyla ) , also known as the ant bear , is a large insectivorous mammal native to Central and South America . It is one of four living species of anteaters and is classified with sloths in the order Pilosa . This species is mostly terrestrial , in contrast to other living anteaters and sloths , which are arboreal or semiarboreal . The giant anteater is the largest of its family , 182 -- in length , with weights of 33 -- for males and 27 -- for females . It is recognizable by its elongated snout , bushy tail , long fore claws , and distinctively colored pelage .   The giant anteater can be found in multiple habitats , including grassland and rainforest . It forages in open areas and rests in more forested habitats . It feeds primarily on ants and termites , using its fore claws to dig them up and its long , sticky tongue to collect them . Though giant anteaters live in overlapping home ranges , they are mostly solitary except during mother-offspring relationships , aggressive interactions between males , and when mating . Mother anteaters carry their offspring on their backs until weaning them .   The giant anteater is listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature . It has been extirpated from many parts of its former range , including nearly all of Central America . Threats to its survival include habitat destruction , fire , and poaching for fur and bushmeat , although some anteaters inhabit protected areas . With its distinctive appearance and habits , the anteater has been featured in pre-Columbian myths and folktales , as well as modern popular culture .",

      "Active vibration control is the active application of force in an equal and opposite fashion to the forces imposed by external vibration . With this application , a precision industrial process can be maintained on a platform essentially vibration-free .   Many precision industrial processes can not take place if the machinery is being affected by vibration . For example , the production of semiconductor wafers requires that the machines used for the photolithography steps be used in an essentially vibration-free environment or the sub-micrometre features will be blurred . Active vibration control is now also commercially available for reducing vibration in helicopters , offering better comfort with less weight than traditional passive technologies .   In the past , passive techniques were used . These include traditional vibration dampers , shock absorbers , and base isolation .   The typical active vibration control system uses several components :  A massive platform suspended by several active drivers ( that may use voice coils , hydraulics , pneumatics , piezo-electric or other techniques )  Three accelerometers that measure acceleration in the three degrees of freedom  An electronic amplifier system that amplifies and inverts the signals from the accelerometers . A PID controller can be used to get better performance than a simple inverting amplifier .  For very large systems , pneumatic or hydraulic components that provide the high drive power required .   If the vibration is periodic , then the control system may adapt to the ongoing vibration , thereby providing better cancellation than would have been provided simply by reacting to each new acceleration without referring to past accelerations .   Active vibration control strategy has been successfully implemented for vibration attenuation of beam , plate and shell structures by numerous researchers . For active vibration control strategy , the structure should be smart enough to sense external disturbances and react accordingly . In order to develop an active structure ( also known as smart structure ) , smart materials must be integrated or embedded with the structure . The smart structure involves sensors ( strain , acceleration , velocity , force etc. ) , actuators ( force , inertial , strain etc. ) and a control algorithm ( feedback or feed forward ) . The number of smart materials have been investigated and fabricated over the years ; some of them are shape memory alloys , piezoelectric materials , optical fibers , electro-rheological fluids , magneto-strictive materials .",
      "CGIDEV2 is a free and open source IBM i ( formerly known as AS/400 ) based program development toolkit that facilitates the development of interactive web-based programs using RPG ILE or Cobol ( using the older CGIDEV version ) as the back-end Common Gateway Interface language . The functionality of this toolset is incorporated into an RPG ILE program by means of a service program that contains all of the procedures required to read input from a browser , generate and send the appropriate response back to the browser . CGIDEV2 is commonly used to generate static or interactive HTML/DHTML pages but it can also produce CSV , XML , Excel-XML and other text based files .   CGIDEV2 was developed by Mel Rothman while he was with IBM Rochester . It was released to the public in 1999 . The product was maintained and promoted by Mr. Rothman and Dr. Giovanni B. Perotti of IBM Italy , who have added enhancements , documentation and code samples to the package . When Dr. Perotti left IBM , the company at first refused to allow him to maintain the product , then later relented . Because the product is written in RPG ILE and comes with complete source , end users have also been able to contribute enhancements to the package and modify it for their specific requirements . In addition to Perotti and Rothman , CGIDEV2 has been enhanced , promoted , or discussed in detail by Brian May , Jon Paris , Susan Gantner , and Brad Stone .   Unlike most web solutions for the iSeries , CGIDEV2 is neither a terminal emulator or an SQL based solution . CGIDEV2 effectively extends widely used RPG programming language with specific procedures for the web . This permits an iSeries programmer to continue to use all of the familiar tools and techniques that they are accustomed to as they develop interactive programs for the web .   A particular feature of the CGIDEV2 toolkit is that it allows the programmer to isolate the HTML in one or more external template files from the executing CGI program , with special tokens in the HTML templates being replaced at run-time via toolkit procedures . This separation of the HTML code from the CGI program promotes the efficient and consistent development and subsequent maintenance of enterprise scale business applications .   Criticism : While CGIDEV2 is a popular choice as a web development languages for RPG programmers on IBM iSeries systems , CGIDEV2 lacks in some features offered by other web development languages such as session management and the ability to design programs using object oriented design principles . IBM 's ambiguous commitment to the CGIDEV2 product and to the iSeries in general is also an issue to some users ."

      "Hammer Film Productions is a British film production company based in London . Founded in 1934 , the company is best known for a series of Gothic `` Hammer Horror '' films made from the mid-1950s until the 1970s . Hammer also produced science fiction , thrillers , film noir and comedies -- and , in later years , television series . During its most successful years , Hammer dominated the horror film market , enjoying worldwide distribution and considerable financial success . This success was due , in part , to distribution partnerships with major United States studios , such as Warner Bros. .   During the late 1960s and 1970s the saturation of the horror film market by competitors and the loss of American funding forced changes to the previously lucrative Hammer formula , with varying degrees of success . The company eventually ceased production in the mid-1980s . In 2000 , the studio was bought by a consortium including advertising executive and art collector Charles Saatchi and publishing millionaires Neil Mendoza and William Sieghart . The company announced plans to begin making films again after this , but none were produced .   In May 2007 , the company was sold again , this time to a consortium headed by Dutch media tycoon John de Mol , who announced plans to spend some $ 50m ( # 25m ) on new horror films . The new owners also acquired the Hammer group 's film library , consisting of 295 movies . Simon Oakes , who took over as CEO of Hammer , said : `` Hammer is a great British brand -- we intend to take it back into production and develop its global potential . The brand is still alive but no one has invested in it for a long time '' . Since then it has produced several films , including Let Me In ( 2010 ) , The Resident ( 2011 ) , The Woman in Black ( 2012 ) and The Quiet Ones ( 2014 ) ."

      "Henry III ( 19 September 1551 -- 2 August 1589 ; born Alexandre \u00c9douard de France , Henryk Walezy , Henrikas Valua ) was a monarch of the House of Valois who was elected the monarch of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from 1573 to 1575 and ruled as King of France from 1574 until his death . He was the last French monarch of the Valois dynasty .   As the fourth son of King Henry II of France and Catherine de ' Medici , Henry was not expected to assume the throne of France . He was thus a good candidate for the vacant Commonwealth throne , and he was elected with the dual titles King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania .   Henry 's rule over the Commonwealth was brief , but notable . The Henrician Articles he signed into law accepting the Commonwealth throne established Poland as an elective monarchy subject to free election by the Polish nobility . Of his three older brothers , two would live long enough to ascend the French throne , but both died young and without a legitimate male heir . He abandoned Commonwealth upon receiving word that he had inherited the throne of France at the age of 22 .   The kingdom of France was at the time plagued by the Wars of Religion , and Henry 's authority was undermined by violent political parties funded by foreign powers : the Catholic League ( supported by Spain ) , the Protestant Huguenots ( supported by England and the Dutch ) and the Malcontents , led by Henry 's own brother , the Duke of Alen\u00e7on , which was a party of Catholic and Protestant aristocrats who jointly opposed the absolutist ambitions of the king . Henry III was himself a politique , arguing that a strong and religiously tolerant monarchy would save France from collapse .   After the death of Henry 's younger brother Francis , Duke of Anjou , and when it became apparent that Henry would not produce an heir , the Wars of Religion grew into a succession crisis that resulted in a war known as the War of the Three Henrys . Henry III 's legitimate heir was his distant cousin Henry , King of Navarre , a Protestant . The Catholic League , led by Henry I , Duke of Guise , sought to exclude Protestants from the succession and championed the Catholic Charles , Cardinal of Bourbon , as Henry III 's heir .   In 1589 , Jacques Cl\u00e9ment , a Catholic fanatic , murdered Henry III , who was succeeded by the King of Navarre who , as Henry IV , would assume the throne of France after converting to Catholicism , and become the first French king of the House of Bourbon .",

      "Night of the Living Dead is a 1968 American independent horror film , directed by George A. Romero , starring Duane Jones and Judith O'Dea . It was completed on a $ 114,000 budget and premiered October 1 , 1968 . The film became a financial success , grossing $ 12 million domestically and $ 18 million internationally . It has been a cult classic ever since . Night of the Living Dead was heavily criticized at its release for its explicit gore . It eventually garnered critical acclaim and has been selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry , as a film deemed `` culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant '' .   The story follows characters Ben ( Jones ) , Barbra ( O'Dea ) , and five others trapped in a rural farmhouse in Western Pennsylvania , which is attacked by a large and growing group of unnamed `` living dead '' monsters drawing on earlier depictions in popular culture of the ghoul , which has led this type of creature to be referred to most popularly as a zombie . This is the most easily recognized version of the living dead , to the point where people gather in mass quantities for conventions dressed as zombies , complete with makeup and prosthetic limbs . Night of the Living Dead led to five subsequent films between 1978 and 2010 , also directed by Romero , and inspired two remakes ; the most well-known remake was released in 1990 , directed by Tom Savini .",

It is located west of the Italian Peninsula , southeast of the French mainland , and north of the Italian island of Sardinia . A single chain of mountains makes up two-thirds of the island .   While being part of France , Corsica is also designated as a territorial collectivity ( collectivit\u00e9 territoriale ) by law . As a territorial collectivity , Corsica enjoys a greater degree of autonomy than other French regions ; for example , the Corsican Assembly is able to exercise limited executive powers .   The island formed a single department until it was split in 1975 into two departments : Haute-Corse ( Upper Corsica ) and Corse-du-Sud ( Southern Corsica ) , with its regional capital in Ajaccio , the prefecture city of Corse-du-Sud . Bastia , the prefecture city of Haute-Corse , is the second-largest settlement in Corsica .   After being ruled by the Republic of Genoa since 1284 , Corsica was briefly an independent Corsican Republic from 1755 until it was conquered by France in 1769 . Due to Corsica 's historical ties with the Italian peninsula , the island retains to this day many elements of the culture of Italy . The native Corsican language , whose northern variant is closely related to the Italian language , is recognised as a regional language by the French government . This Mediterranean island was ruled by various nations over the course of history but had several brief periods of independence .   Napoleon was born in 1769 in the Corsican capital of Ajaccio . His ancestral home , Maison Bonaparte , is today used as a museum .",
      "The midwoofer-tweeter-midwoofer loudspeaker configuration ( called MTM , for short ) was created by Joseph D'Appolito as a way of correcting the inherent lobe tilting of a typical mid-tweeter ( MT ) configuration , at the crossover frequency , unless time-aligned . In the MTM arrangement the loudspeaker uses three drivers : Two mid-range ( or mid-woofer/woofer ) for the low frequencies and a tweeter for the higher frequencies , with the tweeter being placed between the mid-range drivers ( as shown in the second image below ) . D'Appolito initially configured his design using a 3rd order ( 18 dB/oct or 60 dB/dec ) crossover , D'Appolito has since amended this original recommendation in favor of 4th order topology . However , this does not impart any significant effect on the MTM design 's unique characteristics .   There are speakers where the tweeter appears below the larger driver and though electrically it is identical to the MT configuration , it is customarily denoted as `` TM '' . The only other difference is the lobe tilt which is exactly the opposite of the MT configuration .   The direction in which the lobe tilts ( i.e. , the vertical orientation or angle of the lobe ) is a function of the difference or offset between the acoustic centers of the two drivers .",

      "Pocahontas ( born Matoaka , known as Amonute , 1596 -- 1617 ) was a Native American woman notable for her association with the colonial settlement at Jamestown , Virginia . Pocahontas was the daughter of Powhatan , the paramount chief of a network of tributary tribal nations in the Tsenacommacah , encompassing the Tidewater region of Virginia . In a well-known historical anecdote , she is said to have saved the life of a captive of the Native Americans , the Englishman John Smith , in 1607 by placing her head upon his own when her father raised his war club to execute him . Some historians have suggested that this story , as told by Smith , is untrue .   Pocahontas was captured by the English during Anglo-Indian hostilities in 1613 , and held for ransom . During her captivity , she converted to Christianity and took the name Rebecca . When the opportunity arose for her to return to her people , she chose to remain with the English . In April 1614 , she married tobacco planter John Rolfe , and in January 1615 , bore their son , Thomas Rolfe .   In 1616 , the Rolfes traveled to London . Pocahontas was presented to English society as an example of the `` civilized savage '' in hopes of stimulating investment in the Jamestown settlement . She became something of a celebrity , was elegantly f\u00eated , and attended a masque at Whitehall Palace . In 1617 , the Rolfes set sail for Virginia , but Pocahontas died at Gravesend of unknown causes . She was buried in a church in Gravesend in the United Kingdom , but the exact location of her grave is unknown .   Numerous places , landmarks , and products in the United States have been named after Pocahontas . Her story has been romanticized over the years , and she is a subject of art , literature , and film . Many famous people have claimed to be among her descendants through her son Thomas , including members of the First Families of Virginia , First Lady Edith Wilson , American Western actor Glenn Strange , and astronomer Percival Lowell ."

      "The iPhone 4 is a smartphone that was designed and marketed by Apple Inc. . Following a number of notable leaks , the iPhone 4 was first unveiled on June 7 , 2010 , at Apple 's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco , and was released on June 24 , 2010 , in the United States , United Kingdom , France , Germany and Japan . It is the 4th generation of iPhone , succeeding the 3GS and preceding the 4S .   The iPhone 4 introduced a new hardware design to the iPhone family , which Apple 's CEO Steve Jobs touted as the thinnest smartphone in the world at the time ; it consisted of an uninsulated stainless steel frame which doubles as an antenna , with internal components situated between chemically strengthened aluminosilicate glass . The iPhone 4 also introduced Apple 's new high-resolution `` Retina Display '' ; while maintaining the same physical size and aspect ratio as its precursors , its liquid crystal display had a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch . The iPhone 4 also introduced Apple 's A4 system-on-chip , along with iOS 4 -- which notably introduced multitasking functionality and Apple 's new FaceTime video chat service . The iPhone 4 was also the first iPhone to include a front-facing camera , and the first to be released in a version for CDMA networks , ending AT&T 's period as the exclusive carrier of iPhone products in the United States .   It was succeeded as Apple 's flagship smartphone in 2011 by the iPhone 4S . However , iPhone 4 continued to be produced until 2013 .   The iPhone 4 received generally positive reception , with critics praising its revamped design and more powerful hardware in comparison to previous models . While it was a market success , with over 600,000 pre-orders within 24 hours , the release of the iPhone 4 was plagued by highly publicized reports that abnormalities in its new antenna design caused the device to lose its cellular signal if held in a certain way . Most human contact with the phone 's outer edge would cause a significant decrease in signal strength .   The iPhone 4 spent the longest time as Apple 's flagship iPhone model at fifteen months , and had the longest lifespan of any iPhone ever produced , spanning close to four years and available in some developing countries until early 2015 .",

      "Wind run is a meteorological term used to categorize or determine the total distance ( or amount ) of the traveled wind over a period of time . The readings are collected using an anemometer ( usually part of a weather station ) .   Wind run can help to determine the rate of evaporation of moisture over a particular area . It may also be useful in determining the height of waves that might be encountered on large bodies of water . Longer wind runs generate higher waves on open water .

      "Trophy hunting is the selective hunting of wild game for human recreation . The trophy is the animal or part of the animal kept , and usually displayed , to represent the success of the hunt . The primary game sought is usually the oldest and most mature animal from a given population . This is typically a male with the largest body size or largest antlers or horns . Parts of the animal may be kept as a hunting trophy or memorial ( usually the skin , antlers , horns and/or head ) , in most circumstances the carcass itself is usually used for food , sometimes donated to the local community .   Trophy hunting has both firm supporters and strong opponents . Debates surrounding trophy hunting centrally concern not only the question of the morality of recreational hunting and supposed conservation efforts of big-game and ranch hunting , but also the observed decline in animal species that are targets for trophy hunting .   A hunting trophy is an item prepared from the body of a game animal killed by a hunter and kept as a souvenir . Often , the heads or entire bodies are processed by a taxidermist , although sometimes other body parts such as teeth , tusks , horns or hide are used as the trophies .   Such trophies are often displayed in the hunter 's home or office , and often in specially designed `` trophy rooms , '' sometimes called `` game rooms '' or `` gun rooms , '' in which the hunter 's weaponry is displayed as well .",

      "Mormons ( -LSB- \u02c8m\u0254rm\u0259nz -RSB- ) are a religious and cultural group related to Mormonism , the principal branch of the Latter Day Saint movement of Restorationist Christianity , initiated by Joseph Smith in upstate New York during the 1820s . After Smith 's death in 1844 , the Mormons followed Brigham Young to what would become the Utah Territory . Today , most Mormons are understood to be members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( LDS Church ) . Some Mormons are also either independent or non-practicing . The center of Mormon cultural influence is in Utah , and North America has more Mormons than any other continent , though the majority of Mormons live outside the United States .   Mormons have developed a strong sense of communality that stems from their doctrine and history . During the 19th century , Mormon converts tended to gather to a central geographic location , and between 1852 and 1890 a minority of Mormons openly practiced plural marriage , a form of religious polygamy . Mormons dedicate large amounts of time and resources to serving in their church , and many young Mormons choose to serve a full-time proselytizing mission . Mormons have a health code which eschews alcoholic beverages , tobacco , coffee , tea , and other addictive substances . They tend to be very family-oriented , and have strong connections across generations and with extended family , reflective of their belief that families can be sealed together beyond death . Mormons also have a strict law of chastity , requiring abstention from sexual relations outside of heterosexual marriage and fidelity within marriage .   Mormons self-identify as Christian , although some non-Mormons consider Mormons non-Christian and some of their beliefs differ from mainstream Christianity . Mormons believe in the Bible , as well as other books of scripture , such as the Book of Mormon . They have a unique view of cosmology , and believe that all people are spirit-children of God . Mormons believe that returning to God requires following the example of Jesus Christ , and accepting his atonement through ordinances such as baptism . They believe that Christ 's church was restored through Joseph Smith and is guided by living prophets and apostles . Central to Mormon faith is the belief that God speaks to his children and answers their prayers .   Due to their high birth and conversion rates , the Mormon population has grown significantly in recent decades . The number of members in 1971 was 3,090,953 and now in 2017 based on the Annual Report , there are 15,882,417 worldwide .",

      "Purfling is a narrow decorative edge inlaid into the top plate and often the back plate of a stringed instrument . Inexpensive instruments may have no purfling and instead simulate the appearance with paint .   Purfling was originally made of laminated strips of wood , often contrasting in color as a visual accent . The earliest known example of purfling is on a violin made by Andrea Amati in 1564 , now on display in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford University . It consists of two outer strips of pearwood stained black and an inner strip of poplar .   Eventually , nacre from shell , usually mother of pearl or abalone , and other hard inlay materials were incorporated to provide highly decorative effects . Elaborate inlay is found most often on fretted instruments . Laminates and composites made from nacreous shell and synthetic materials , described as `` fake '' , `` faux '' , or `` shin paua '' , are sometimes used by luthiers . The channel cut for the inlay of purfling may increase the flexibility of the plates where they join the sides , affecting an instrument 's pitch and sustain . In cases of heavy decorative inlay , the effective vibrational area of the sound board may be reduced .   Today plastic purfling is commonplace in mass-produced instruments . One common example of plastic purfling is a sandwich of three alternating strips in black and white , measuring about 1.25 x. However , many distinctive variations are used .   Binding is a narrow outer strip of material on the edges of the body of stringed instruments such as lutes , mandolins , guitars and ukuleles . Binding may be made of thin wood strips . It is applied along the entire edge of top and back plates . While it can provide a decorative function , the primary purpose of binding is to block the transfer of moisture by the hygroscopic end grain of the plates of the instrument . This prevents cracks in a way that purfling can not . It also reduces wear to instrument body edges . Hardwood , fruitwood , plastics and other synthetic materials are commonly used to make bindings . Binding may be used along the sides of fingerboards of fretted instruments . It softens the feel of the neck as one 's fretting hand slides past the thin metal ends of fret wire , and it provides decorative appeal .",

      "Mutiny on the Bounty is a 1962 American Technicolor epic historical drama film starring Marlon Brando , Trevor Howard and Richard Harris , based on the novel Mutiny on the Bounty by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall .   The film retells the 1789 real-life mutiny aboard HMAV Bounty led by Fletcher Christian against the ship 's captain , William Bligh . It is the second American film to be made from the novel , the first being Mutiny on the Bounty ( 1935 ) . It was directed by Lewis Milestone , who replaced Carol Reed early in the production schedule , and it turned out to be Milestone 's final film .   The screenplay was written by Charles Lederer ( with uncredited input from Eric Ambler , William L. Driscoll , Borden Chase , John Gay and Ben Hecht ) . The score was composed by Bronis\u0142aw Kaper .   Mutiny on the Bounty was filmed in the Ultra Panavision 70 widescreen process , the first motion picture so credited . It was partly shot on location in the South Pacific . Behind the scenes , Marlon Brando effectively took over directing duties himself and caused it to become far behind schedule and over budget -- resulting in director Carol Reed pulling out of the project and being replaced by Lewis Milestone who is credited as director of the picture . The film was heavily panned , and was considered a box office bomb , having lost over $ 6 million .   A replica of the Bounty was constructed for the film . Fifty years after the release of the film , the vessel sank in Hurricane Sandy with loss of life ."

      "Watchmen is a 2009 American superhero film directed by Zack Snyder , based on the 1986 -- 87 DC Comics limited series of the same name by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons . It stars an ensemble cast of Malin \u00c5kerman , Billy Crudup , Matthew Goode , Carla Gugino , Jackie Earle Haley , Jeffrey Dean Morgan , and Patrick Wilson . A dark satirical and dystopian take on the superhero genre , the film is set in an alternate history in the year 1985 at the height of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union , as a group of mostly retired American superheroes investigates the murder of one of their own before uncovering an elaborate and deadly conspiracy , while their moral limitations are challenged by the complex nature of the circumstances .   From October 1987 until October 2005 , a live-action film adaptation of the Watchmen series became stranded in development hell ; producer Lawrence Gordon began developing the project at 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros. , the parent company of Watchmen publisher DC Comics , with producer Joel Silver and director Terry Gilliam , with the latter eventually deeming the complex comic `` un-filmable '' . During the 2000s , Gordon and Lloyd Levin collaborated with Universal Studios and Paramount Pictures to produce a script by David Hayter ; Darren Aronofsky and Paul Greengrass were also attached to the project before it was cancelled over budget disputes ; and in October 2005 , the project returned to Warner Bros. , where Snyder was hired to direct ; Paramount remained as its international distributor whereas Warner Bros. would distribute the film in the United States . However , Fox sued Warner Bros. for copyright violation arising from Gordon 's failure to pay a buy-out in 1991 , which enabled him to develop the film at the other studios . Fox and Warner Bros. settled this before the film 's release , with Fox receiving a portion of the gross . Principal photography began in Vancouver , September 2007 . As with his previous film 300 , Snyder closely modelled his storyboards on the comic , but chose not to shoot all of Watchmen using green screens and opted for real sets instead .   Following its world premiere at Odeon Leicester Square on February 23 , 2009 , the film was released in both conventional and IMAX theaters on March 6 , 2009 , and grossed $ 55 million on its opening weekend and over $ 185 million at the worldwide box office . The film 's reception has been very polarized , with many critics voicing strong negative views and vice versa .

      "Buffy the Vampire Slayer is an American television series created by Joss Whedon under his production tag , Mutant Enemy Productions with later co-executive producers being Jane Espenson , David Fury , David Greenwalt , Doug Petrie , Marti Noxon , and David Solomon . The series premiered on March 10 , 1997 , on The WB and concluded on May 20 , 2003 , on UPN . The series narrative follows Buffy Summers ( played by Sarah Michelle Gellar ) , the latest in a line of young women known as `` Vampire Slayers '' , or simply `` Slayers '' . In the story , Slayers are `` called '' ( chosen by fate ) to battle against vampires , demons , and other forces of darkness . Like previous Slayers , Buffy is aided by a Watcher , who guides , teaches , and trains her . Unlike her predecessors , Buffy surrounds herself with a circle of loyal friends who become known as the `` Scooby Gang '' .   The series received critical and popular acclaim , frequently being listed as one of the greatest TV shows of all time , and usually reached between four and six million viewers on original airings . Although such ratings are lower than successful shows on the `` big four '' networks ( ABC , CBS , NBC , and Fox ) , they were a success for the relatively new and smaller WB Television Network .   Buffy 's success has led to hundreds of tie-in products , including novels , comics , and video games .

She occasionally receives prophetic dreams in the few hours that she sleeps .   The opening narration in the Buffy series states `` Into every generation a slayer is born : one girl in all the world , a chosen one . She alone will wield the strength and skill to fight the vampires , demons , and the forces of darkness ; to stop the spread of their evil and the swell of their number . She is the Slayer . ''   While , in the series , they are commonly referred to as `` Vampire Slayers '' , even by Watchers and vampires themselves , the Slayer may operate as a defender against any and all supernatural threats .   The reputation of the Slayer is well-known and revered , even throughout other dimensions . The notion of The Slayer has been compared to the equivalent of a Demonic `` Boogey-Man , '' incredibly feared and considered by most to be essentially unconquerable .",

      "Throughout its history , the National Football League ( NFL ) and other rival American football leagues have used several different formats to determine their league champions , including a period of inter-league matchups determining a true world champion .   The NFL first determined champions through end-of-season standings , but switched to a playoff system in 1933 . The rival All-America Football Conference ( AAFC ) and American Football League ( AFL ) have since merged with the NFL ( the only two AAFC teams that currently exist joined the NFL in -- the Cleveland Browns and the San Francisco 49ers ) , but AAFC championship games and records are not included in NFL record books . The AFL began play in 1960 and , like its rival league , used a playoff system to determine its champion .   From -- prior to the merger in 1970 , the NFL and the AFL agreed to hold an ultimate championship game , first called the AFL-NFL World Championship Game and later renamed the Super Bowl after 1968 . Following the merger in 1970 , the Super Bowl name continued as the game to determine the NFL champion . The most important factor of the merger was that all ten AFL teams joined the NFL in and every AFL championship game and record is included in NFL record books . The old NFL Championship Game became the NFC Championship Game , while the old AFL Championship Game became the AFC Championship Game . The NFL lists the old AFL/NFL championship games with `` new '' AFC/NFC championship games in its record books . The Green Bay Packers have won the most championships with 13 total ( 9 NFL championships pre-merger , four ( 4 ) Super Bowl championships ) . The Packers are also the only team to win three consecutive championships , having done so twice ( 1929 -- 1931 , 1965 -- 1967 ) . The Chicago Bears have won the second most overall championships with nine ( 9 ) ( eight NFL championships , one Super Bowl championship ) .",

It is the country 's political , cultural , economic , and academic center . It was known in the Roman period under the name Scupi .   The territory of Skopje has been inhabited since at least 4000 BC ; remains of Neolithic settlements have been found within the old Kale Fortress that overlooks the modern city centre . On the eve of the 1st century AD , the settlement was seized by the Romans and became a military camp . When the Roman Empire was divided into eastern and western halves in 395 AD , Scupi came under Byzantine rule from Constantinople . During much of the early medieval period , the town was contested between the Byzantines and the Bulgarian Empire , whose capital it was between 972 and 992 . From 1282 , the town was part of the Serbian Empire and acted as its capital city from 1346 to 1371 . In 1392 , the city was conquered by the Ottoman Turks who called the town \u00dcsk\u00fcp . The town stayed under Turkish control for over 500 years , serving as the capital of pashasanjak of \u00dcsk\u00fcb and later the Vilayet of Kosovo . At that time the city was famous for its oriental architecture . In 1912 , it was annexed by the Kingdom of Serbia during the Balkan Wars and after the First World War the city became part of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes ( Kingdom of Yugoslavia ) . In the Second World War the city was conquered by the Bulgarian Army , which was part of the Axis powers . In 1944 , it became the capital city of Democratic Macedonia ( later Socialist Republic of Macedonia ) , which was a federal state , part of Democratic Federal Yugoslavia ( later Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ) . The city developed rapidly after World War II , but this trend was interrupted in 1963 when it was hit by a disastrous earthquake . In 1991 , it became the capital city of an independent Macedonia .   Skopje is located on the upper course of the Vardar River , and is located on a major north-south Balkan route between Belgrade and Athens .

      "`` Another Summer Night '' was the Maltese entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2001 , performed in English by Fabrizio Faniello .   The song is a moderately up-tempo number , with Faniello describing an idyllic summer night `` by the ocean/Under the palm trees , you and I '' . He sings that this is `` magic '' and presents the scenario as a perfect way to be with his lover . In contrast to the fast tempo songs beginning to dominate the Contest by this point , the song is quite laid-back with an acoustic guitar ( first introduced immediately after Faniello sings `` A guitar in my hand '' ) providing a melodic counterpoint .   The song was performed twenty-first on the night , following Estonia 's Tanel Padar and Dave Benton with `` Everybody '' and preceding Greece 's Antique with `` Die For You '' . At the close of voting , it had received 48 points , placing 9th in a field of 23 .   Despite the comparatively low placing , the song has become popular among Contest fans , with Faniello performing it as part of a medley at the Congratulations special in late 2005 .   It was succeeded as Maltese representative at the 2002 contest by Ira Losco with `` 7th Wonder '' .

      "Radar in World War II greatly influenced many important aspects of the conflict . This revolutionary new technology of radio-based detection and tracking was used by both the Allies and Axis powers in World War II , which had evolved independently in a number of nations during the mid 1930s . At the outbreak of war in September 1939 , both Great Britain and Germany had functioning radar systems . In Great Britain , it was called RDF , Range and Direction Finding , while in Germany the name Funkmessger\u00e4t ( radio measuring device ) was used .   By the time of the Battle of Britain in mid-1940 , the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) had fully integrated RDF as part of the national air defence .   Although the technology was first demonstrated in the United States during December 1934 , it was only when war became likely that the U.S. recognized the potential of the new technology , and began development of ship - and land-based systems . The first of these were fielded by the U.S. Navy in early 1940 , and a year later by the U.S. Army . The acronym RADAR ( for RAdio Detection And Ranging ) was coined by the U.S. Navy in 1940 , and the term `` radar '' became widely used .   While the benefits of operating in the microwave portion of the radio spectrum were known , transmitters for generating microwave signals of sufficient power were unavailable ; thus , all early radar systems operated at lower frequencies ( e.g. , HF or VHF ) . In February 1940 , Great Britain developed the resonant-cavity magnetron , capable of producing microwave power in the kilowatt range , opening the path to second-generation radar systems .   After the Fall of France , it was realised in Great Britain that the manufacturing capabilities of the United States were vital to success in the war ; thus , although America was not yet a belligerent , Prime Minister Winston Churchill directed that the technology secrets of Great Britain be shared in exchange for the needed capabilities . In the summer of 1940 , the Tizard Mission visited the United States . The cavity magnetron was demonstrated to Americans at RCA , Bell Labs , etc. . It was 100 times as powerful than anything they had seen . Bell Labs was able to duplicate the performance , and the Radiation Laboratory at MIT was established to develop microwave radars . It was later described by noted Historian James Phinney Baxter III as `` The most valuable cargo ever brought to our shores '' .   In addition to Great Britain , Germany , and the United States , wartime radars were also developed and used by the Soviet Union and Japan , as well as the technically advanced Commonwealth Nations Australia , Canada , New Zealand , and South Africa ."

      "The County of Monz\u00f3n was a marcher county of the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n in the tenth and eleventh centuries , during a period of renewed external threat ( the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba ) and disintegration of royal authority . The county was created by Ramiro II for Ansur Fern\u00e1ndez in 943 and was ruled by his descendants , the Banu Ans\u00farez , for decades . The seat of the county was initially at the castle of Curiel and later at Monteson ; to its east the river Pisuerga served as a border with the County of Castile . The County of Monz\u00f3n straddled both banks of the Duero : south of the river its territories comprised Pe\u00f1afiel or Sacramenia , north of the river it extended to the Cantabrian Mountains and included the populations of Redondos , Mud\u00e1 , Rueda de Pisuerga , and Salinas de Pisuerga .   Ansur 's successor as count was his son Fernando , who had five brothers . All five appear to have predeceased him and when he died he had no sons . His successor was his sister , Teresa Ans\u00farez , and , through her , her son , king Ramiro III of Le\u00f3n . The king immediately travelled to Santa Mar\u00eda de Fusiellos , the chief religious centre of the county , and endowed it with the villages of San Juli\u00e1n and Abandella in order to secure local support ( and for the good of his soul ) . Fernando 's widow , Toda , was allowed to retain the title cometissa ( countess ) and govern the city of Due\u00f1as , which was part of Monz\u00f3n .   The county disappears from contemporary records during its attachment to the crown , and it appears to have been incorporated into Castile after the tumultuous succession of Vermudo II in 985 . The Castilian count Garc\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez made a donation of the village of Santiago del Val in the county of Monz\u00f3n to the monastery of San Isidro de Due\u00f1as in the same county , indicating both his ability to dispose of Monz\u00f3n 's lands and his patronage of the church in Monz\u00f3n . A charter of San Isidro for the year 990 refers to the king and the count of Castile , but not to any count of Monz\u00f3n . The first sure indication that the Castilians were in control of Monz\u00f3n comes from a document of Sancho III of Pamplona , which describes how he came to control Castile and Monz\u00f3n . It notes that Sancho Garc\u00eda possedit ... Castella et Monteson ( possessed Castile and Monz\u00f3n ) `` after Fernando -LSB- Ans\u00farez -RSB- '' , though the document does not mention any intervening rulers . After Sancho Garc\u00eda 's death ( 1017 ) , the king of Navarre , with his mother , Jimena Fern\u00e1ndez , and the new count of Castile , Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez , with his mother , Urraca , came together to confirm the privileges of Monz\u00f3n and Due\u00f1as at Husillos for the benefit of the late count 's soul . ( Sancho of Pamplona was married to Muniaona , Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez 's sister . ) Monz\u00f3n remained with the county of Castile until 1038 , when the count of Castile , Fernando S\u00e1nchez , became king . The boundaries of the later Kingdom of Castile included the old county of Monz\u00f3n . In 1067 Sancho II of Castile made the monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda de Mamblas south of the Duero a daughter house of Santo Domingo de Silos . It is probable that Mamblas represents the southwest extremity of the county of Monz\u00f3n as inherited by Sancho Garc\u00eda .   Historian Justo P\u00e9rez de Urbel 's argument that in 985 Monz\u00f3n was annexed by the Banu G\u00f3mez clan that ruled Salda\u00f1a and Carri\u00f3n was based on a document of 995 that names them as the only rulers between Zamora and Castile , without specifying the boundaries of the latter . The fourteenth-century historian Ibn Khaldun also thought Monz\u00f3n to have been a territory of the Banu G\u00f3mez , but his witness is too late to be of independent value .",

      "Halo 2 is a 2004 first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie Studios . Released for the Xbox video game console on November 9 , 2004 , the game is the second installment in the Halo franchise and the sequel to 2001 's critically acclaimed Halo : Combat Evolved . A Microsoft Windows version of the game was released on May 31 , 2007 , developed by an internal team at Microsoft Game Studios known as Hired Gun . The game features a new game engine , as well as using the Havok physics engine ; added weapons and vehicles , and new multiplayer maps . The player alternately assumes the roles of the human Master Chief and the alien Arbiter in a 26th-century conflict between the human United Nations Space Command and genocidal Covenant .   After the success of Combat Evolved , a sequel was expected and highly anticipated . Bungie found inspiration in plot points and gameplay elements that had been left out of their first game , including multiplayer over the Internet through Xbox Live . Time constraints forced a series of cutbacks in the size and scope of the game , including a cliffhanger ending to the game 's campaign mode that left many in the studio dissatisfied . Among Halo 2s marketing efforts was an alternate reality game called `` I Love Bees '' that involved players solving real-world puzzles .   On release , Halo 2 was the most popular video game on Xbox Live , holding that rank until the release of Gears of War for the Xbox 360 nearly two years later . By June 20 , 2006 , more than 500 million games of Halo 2 had been played and more than 710 million hours have been spent playing it on Xbox Live ; by May 9 , 2007 , the number of unique players had risen to over five million . Halo 2 is the best-selling first-generation Xbox game with at least 6.3 million copies sold in the United States alone . The game received critical acclaim , with most publications lauding the strong multiplayer component . The campaign however , was the focus of criticism for its cliffhanger ending .   A high-definition remake of Halo 2 was released as part of Halo : The Master Chief Collection on November 11 , 2014 , for the Xbox One .",

      "The Burnt Lands is an alvar between Almonte and Ottawa near Upper Huntley , Ontario , Canada . It probably obtained its name from one of the forest fires that swept the area during early European settlement . It is possible that fires assist in creating or maintaining alvars . However , the shallow soil , with alternating drought and flooding , is likely the main factor . The main point is that in a land that is typically covered in forest , alvars provide small area of open prairie-like conditions for plants that require such conditions .   Some of the distinctive plants include Cooper 's milk vetch and Ram 's - Head Ladyslipper . There are 82 breeding bird species and 48 butterfly species . The alvar is thought to have existed in some form since the end of the last ice age , since it has globally rare snails and even a kind of carabid beetle found nowhere else in the world .   This alvar is one of the best examples of this habitat type in Lanark County , and in southern Ontario . It has been the subject of numerous scientific studies . Because of its significance , The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources has designated ca 1,500 acres of the alvar as an Area of Natural and Scientific Interest . A smaller parcel of several hundred acres is protected within the Burnt Lands Provincial Park ( Nature Reserve ) .   It is a popular destination with local naturalists , including bird-watchers and photographers .   Threats to the alvar include urban sprawl , subdivisions , quarries , illegal dumping of household trash and construction materials , illegal sand quarrying , and all-terrain vehicles . There is also a problem with jack pine trees , once planted by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources , that are now shading out some of the rare plant species ; some experts suggest that these trees need to be removed . A fire in 1999 removed some of the encroaching forest and produced open meadows , which , in 2008 had nearly twice the number of plant species as in adjoining unburned areas .",

Historically , when professional sports had much less money to pay players and coaches or managers , it was much more common to find them . Likewise , where player-coaches exist today , they are more common at the lower levels where money is less available , but not exclusively .",
      "A sound film is a motion picture with synchronized sound , or sound technologically coupled to image , as opposed to a silent film . The first known public exhibition of projected sound films took place in Paris in 1900 , but decades passed before sound motion pictures were made commercially practical . Reliable synchronization was difficult to achieve with the early sound-on-disc systems , and amplification and recording quality were also inadequate . Innovations in sound-on-film led to the first commercial screening of short motion pictures using the technology , which took place in 1923 .   The primary steps in the commercialization of sound cinema were taken in the mid - to late 1920s . At first , the sound films which included synchronized dialogue , known as `` talking pictures '' , or `` talkies '' , were exclusively shorts . The earliest feature-length movies with recorded sound included only music and effects . The first feature film originally presented as a talkie was The Jazz Singer , released in October 1927 . A major hit , it was made with Vitaphone , which was at the time the leading brand of sound-on-disc technology . Sound-on-film , however , would soon become the standard for talking pictures .   By the early 1930s , the talkies were a global phenomenon . In the United States , they helped secure Hollywood 's position as one of the world 's most powerful cultural/commercial centers of influence ( see Cinema of the United States ) . In Europe ( and , to a lesser degree , elsewhere ) , the new development was treated with suspicion by many filmmakers and critics , who worried that a focus on dialogue would subvert the unique aesthetic virtues of soundless cinema . In Japan , where the popular film tradition integrated silent movie and live vocal performance , talking pictures were slow to take root . In India , sound was the transformative element that led to the rapid expansion of the nation 's film industry .",

      "The British Deaf Association ( BDA ) is a deaf-led British charity that campaigns and advocates for deaf people who use British Sign Language .   It was preceded by the National Association for the Deaf and Dumb ( NADD ) , which had been founded by deaf people in 1886 . The creation of the NADD had been in response to the perceived threats to the language and education rights of deaf people which had arisen after the Milan Conference of 1880 . This international congress , where the majority of those attending were hearing teachers of deaf children , had passed a resolution banning the use of sign languages throughout the world . The participants of the conference had then returned to their home countries , determined to eradicate both the employment of deaf teachers and the use of sign language in schools . They also sought to reduce class sizes to those that were manageable by hearing teachers .   A Royal Commission on the education of deaf children was launched in 1889 but it failed to consult deaf people and supported the establishment of the Pure Oral System and so the banning of sign language ; in response the magazine Deaf Mute encouraged deaf people to unite in defence of their own interests .   In 1889 , the NADD ceased to exist and so four deaf men , including Francis Maginn and George Healey , arranged a meeting in January 1890 at St. Saviours Church for the Deaf , Oxford Street , London , that they called the `` National Conference of Adult Deaf and Dumb Missions and Associations '' . The conference considered the forming of a national society to `` elevate the education and social status of the Deaf and Dumb in the United Kingdom '' and resulted in the formation of the British Deaf and Dumb Association ( BDDA ) in Leeds on 24 July 1890 . The BDDA deleted the world `` Dumb '' from its title in 1971 . It was n't until the 1970s that schools began to look again at accepting sign language .   The advent of sign language and its acceptance by the general public resulted in deaf leaders slowly coming back to the forefront starting with Jock Young as the first deaf chair in 1983 and , in the mid-1990s , its first deaf chief executive , Jeff McWhinney .   In the 1990s the BDA became a deaf-led organisation and the campaigning for the recognition of sign language is to date the main focus of their work . The current Chair is Terry Riley , recently retired as the Editor of the BBC 's See Hear programme .",

      "Jefferson Finis Davis ( June 3 , 1808 -- December 6 , 1889 ) was an American politician who was a Democratic U.S. Representative and Senator from Mississippi , the 23rd U.S. Secretary of War , and the President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War . He took personal charge of the Confederate war plans but was unable to find a strategy to defeat the more populous and industrialized Union . His diplomatic efforts failed to gain recognition from any foreign country , and at home , the collapsing Confederate economy forced his government to print more and more paper money to cover the war 's expenses , leading to runaway inflation and devaluation of the Confederate dollar .   Davis was born in Kentucky to a moderately prosperous farmer , and grew up on his older brother Joseph 's large cotton plantations in Mississippi and Louisiana . Joseph Davis also secured his appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point . After graduating , Jefferson Davis served six years as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army . He fought in the Mexican -- American War ( 1846 -- 1848 ) , as the colonel of a volunteer regiment . He served as the U.S. Secretary of War from 1853 to 1857 under President Franklin Pierce , and as a Democratic U.S. senator from Mississippi . Before the war , he operated a large cotton plantation in Mississippi but never owned more than 74 slaves . After the war had ended , he remained a proud apologist for the cause of slavery for which he and the Confederacy had fought . Although Davis argued against secession in 1858 , he believed that each state was sovereign and had an unquestionable right to secede from the Union .   Davis 's first wife , Sarah Knox Taylor , died of malaria after three months of marriage , and he also struggled with recurring bouts of the disease . He was unhealthy for much of his life . At the age of 36 , Davis married again , to 18-year-old Varina Howell , a native of Natchez who had been educated in Philadelphia and had some family ties in the North . They had six children . Only two survived him , and only one married and had children .   Many historians attribute the Confederacy 's weaknesses to the poor leadership of President Davis . His preoccupation with detail , reluctance to delegate responsibility , lack of popular appeal , feuds with powerful state governors and generals , favoritism toward old friends , inability to get along with people who disagreed with him , neglect of civil matters in favor of military ones , and resistance to public opinion all worked against him . Historians agree he was a much less effective war leader than his Union counterpart Abraham Lincoln . After Davis was captured in 1865 , he was accused of treason and imprisoned at Fort Monroe . He was never tried and was released after two years . While not disgraced , Davis had been displaced in ex-Confederate affection after the war by his leading general , Robert E. Lee . Davis wrote a memoir entitled The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government , which he completed in 1881 . By the late 1880s , he began to encourage reconciliation , telling Southerners to be loyal to the Union . Ex-Confederates came to appreciate his role in the war , seeing him as a Southern patriot , and he became a hero of the Lost Cause in the post-Reconstruction South .",

      "The cabinet of Governor of New York David Paterson consists of the executive chamber , and the heads of the various departments of the Government of New York . On Paterson 's first day as governor , he asked for letters of resignation from all of the top staff members and state agency commissioners appointed by previous Governor Eliot Spitzer . This typical action does not mean the holdovers from the Spitzer administration will be replaced , and Paterson said that `` having the letters gives him the flexibility to make changes if he decides to '' .   Paterson is responsible for appointing his Executive Chamber . These appointments do not require the confirmation of the New York State Senate . Most political advisors report to the Secretary to the Governor , while most policy advisors report to the Director of State Operations , who also answers to the Secretary to the Governor , making that position , in practice , the true Chief of Staff and most powerful position in the Cabinet . In the Executive Chamber of Eliot Spitzer , the literal Chief of Staff was in charge of the Office of Scheduling and held no authority over other cabinet officials . Paterson has thus far taken a different approach , appointing Jon R. Cohen as titular Chief of Staff , although his function will be as a policy advisor .   The governor is also charged with naming the heads of the various departments , divisions , boards , and offices within the state government . These nominees require confirmation by the state Senate . While some appointees may share the title of commissioner , director , etc. , only department-level heads are considered members of the actual state cabinet , although the heads of the various divisions , boards , and offices may attend cabinet level meetings from time to time .",

The Mongols ( also called `` Tatars '' ) began attacking Europe in the 1220s . They conquered most of Russia and then headed west in the late 1230s . In almost every battle the Christian armies were destroyed and much of Hungary , Poland , Austria and the Balkans were laid waste by Batu Khan , grandson of Genghis Khan . It is known that the Mongols overran Zagreb and swept through Lika and Dalmatia but were unable to take Vinodol . The extent of death and destruction dealt out by the Mongols was compared to an epidemic of the black plague .   Arriving at the Grobnik field , the Mongols encountered a native Croatian army that tried to stop their advantage and invasion . In the battle that followed , the Mongols were destroyed , losing an entire army of 30,000 people led by the notorious army leader Batu Khan . It is believed that Grobnik ( `` field of graves '' ) got its name from the many graves that were used after the battle due to great casualties . It was one of the last battles of the Mongols in Europe , after which they retreated to their homeland in far Asia . There seems to be no certain evidence of the battle uncovered on the battlefield . Many scholars and historians have long doubted and still are arguing if the battle ever took place . Most of them acknowledge that battle did n't occur at all . There has been no physical evidence of a battle uncovered on the supposed battlefield , nor is the battle mentioned in any document from that time . The first accounts about this battle are mentioned in the documents from the 14th century , but some claim that they were either a hoax or not verifiable . Legend also has it that the Croats also fought off a Turkish invasion at Grobnik field several centuries later by wearing the heads of cows and other animals ( see zvon\u010dari ) , scaring the enemy .",

      "Visceral pain is pain that results from the activation of nociceptors of the thoracic , pelvic , or abdominal viscera ( organs ) . Visceral structures are highly sensitive to distension ( stretch ) , ischemia and inflammation , but relatively insensitive to other stimuli that normally evoke pain such as cutting or burning . Visceral pain is diffuse , difficult to localize and often referred to a distant , usually superficial , structure . It may be accompanied by symptoms such as nausea , vomiting , changes in vital signs as well as emotional manifestations . The pain may be described as sickening , deep , squeezing , and dull . Distinct structural lesions or biochemical abnormalities explain this type of pain in only a proportion of patients . These diseases are grouped under gastrointestinal neuromuscular diseases ( GINMD ) . Others can experience visceral pains , often very intense in nature , without any evidence of structural , biochemical or histolopathologic reason for such symptoms . These diseases are grouped under functional gastrointestinal disorders ( FGID ) and the pathophysiology and treatment can vary greatly from GINMD . The two major single entities among functional disorders of the gut are functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome .   Visceral hypersensitivity is a term used to describe hypersensitive visceral pain perception , which is commonly experienced by individuals with functional gastrointestinal disorders .",

      "The great white shark ( Carcharodon carcharias ) , also known as the great white , white pointer , white shark , or white death , is a species of large mackerel shark which can be found in the coastal surface waters of all the major oceans . The great white shark is notable for its size , with mature female individuals growing up to 6.1 m in length and 1950 kg in weight . However most are smaller , males measuring 11 to and females 15 to on average . According to a 2014 study the lifespan of great white sharks is estimated to be as long as 70 years or more , well above previous estimates , making it one of the longest lived cartilaginous fish currently known . According to the same study , male great white sharks take 26 years to reach sexual maturity , while the females take 33 years to be ready to produce offspring . Great white sharks can accelerate to over 56 km/h for short bursts .   The great white shark has no known natural predators other than the killer whale . The great white shark is arguably the world 's largest known extant macropredatory fish , and is one of the primary predators of marine mammals . It is also known to prey upon a variety of other marine animals , including fish and seabirds . It is the only known surviving species of its genus Carcharodon , and is ranked first in having the most recorded shark bite incidents on humans . The IUCN list the great white shark as a vulnerable species , while it is included in Appendix II of CITES .   The novel Jaws by Peter Benchley and the subsequent film by Steven Spielberg depicted the great white shark as a `` ferocious man eater '' . Humans are not the preferred prey of the great white shark , but , nevertheless , the great white is responsible for the largest number of reported and identified fatal unprovoked shark attacks on humans .",
      "In astrology , exaltation is one of the five essential dignities of a planet . Each of the seven traditional planets has its exaltation in one zodiac sign . The positions are :   Sun : 19th degree of Aries ( i.e. , 18 \u00b0 00 ' - 18 \u00b0 59 ' )  Moon : 3rd degree of Taurus  Mercury : 15th degree of Virgo  Venus : 27th degree of Pisces  Mars : 28th degree of Capricorn  Jupiter : 15th degree of Cancer  Saturn : 21st degree of Libra   Exaltations have also been attributed to the north node ( 3rd degree of Gemini ) and the south node ( 3rd degree of Sagittarius ) . These positions are listed in astrological texts of the early medieval Arabic period , such as al-Biruni 's 11th-century Book of Instruction in the Elements of the Art of Astrology . Whilst modern Vedic astrologers place significance on the exaltation positions of the nodes , the western astrological tradition transmitted through medieval Europe demonstrates little use of them in practice traditionally and currently . Al-Biruni also points out that , in contradiction to the Greeks and Persians , the Hindu astrologers of his period disagreed upon the degree positions of the Sun , Jupiter and Saturn , and did not recognize the exaltations of the nodes - a principle he described himself as being `` quite proper '' .   The exaltations are one of the most ancient astrological factors still in use . They are used in ancient Mesopotamian astrology from an era which pre-dates the known use of the zodiac ( using reference to constellation positions which shows correspondence with those later attributed to zodiac degrees ) . Francesca Rochberg has pointed out that since the system is found in the tradition of Enuma anu enlil , its roots may extend into the second millennium BCE . Joanne Conman has shown that certain decan stars the ancient Egyptians venerated in Middle Kingdom Coffin Texts appear to be the source of the `` places of secret '' of the later Babylonian astrological texts referenced by Rochberg and of the corresponding planetary exaltations or hypsomata of Hellenistic astrology . The coffin texts pre-date attested Babylonian astrological texts . The pattern of the honored decans matches and appears to account for the pattern of the exaltation for four of the planets .   Why the Babylonians considered these placements to be dignified is not known to Western astrologers . Although many speculations concerning the reasoning behind it have been put forth over the centuries , there are , as Robert Hand has said , still anomalies that are almost impossible to explain with any consistency , such as the exaltation of vigorous Mars in cold Capricorn . The Western sidereal astrologer , Cyril Fagan , has speculated that the planets all rose heliacally at these degrees in the year of the erection of an important temple to the Babylonian god Nabu in the year 786 BC , but this is still very speculative .   Since in Hellenistic astrology aspects were generally recognised from sign to sign , it is uncertain whether the distance of a planet from the exact degree of exaltation had much significance . However , the degree itself was used by ancient astrologers ; for example , the exact degree of exaltation of each of the luminaries ( the Sun and Moon ) was used in the formula for the Hellenistic Lot of Exaltation .   In later Medieval astrology , influenced by the Arab and Byzantine , a hierarchy of all five essential dignities was favored , in which the most important dignity was that of the domicile ruler , followed in importance by exaltation . Medieval astrologers assigned numerical values to each dignity in the hierarchy , and these were tabulated to provide a rough statistical mode of comparison ( see Essential dignity . ) These weighted valuations are still in use today by astrologers .   After the discovery of the three outer planets -- Uranus , Neptune , and Pluto -- modern astrologers speculated on possible domicile and exaltation rulerships for these planets . It was suggested , for example , that Neptune was the `` true '' domicile ruler of Pisces ( usurping one of Jupiter 's two domicile rulerships ) . The ancient system was complex and symmetrical , making no allowance for additional , unseen planets , and it is difficult to include them in traditional techniques . Most modern astrologers have therefore abandoned attempts to assign exaltations to these newer planets .   Traditional Hindu Astrology , based the notion of exaltation primarily on the stellar constellations , also called Nakshatras , in which the planet fell . There are 27 Nakshatras present in the Sidereal Zodiac . Taking 360 \u00b0 / 27 results in a precise arc of 13 \u00b0 20 \u2032 per Nakshatra , remembering that 60 \u2032 constitute 1 \u00b0 . For example , although Jupiter is exalted in Cancer there are 3 different Nakshatras Jupiter could occupy within the 30 \u00b0 arc of Cancer , namely , Punarvasu ( 20 \u00b0 00 \u2032 Gemini to 3 \u00b0 20 Cancer ) , Pushya ( 3 \u00b0 20 \u2032 to 16 \u00b0 40 \u2032 Cancer ) , and Ashlesha ( 16 \u00b0 40 \u2032 to 29 \u00b0 59 \u2032 Cancer ) . Since Jupiter is exalted at 5 \u00b0 Cancer this placement signifies his true exaltation in Pushya Nakshatra . The Nakshatra Devata of Pushya is B\u1e5bhaspati , the teacher of the Gods . Jupiter will not give his full exaltation effects when he is posited in a Nakshatra besides Pushya although he is still generally exalted in the sign of Cancer . Furthermore , each Nakshatra is divided into four sections , also called p\u0101da , and when taking 13 \u00b0 20 \u2032 / 4 results in a precise arc of 3 \u00b0 20 \u2032 per p\u0101da . The four p\u0101da denote the four goals of life according to the Vedic tradition , namely , Dharma , Artha , K\u0101ma , and Mok\u1e63a . Although Jupiter finds strong exaltation in Pushya there are four different p\u0101da Jupiter could occupy within the 13 \u00b0 20 \u2032 arc of Pushya , namely , Dharma p\u0101da ( 3 \u00b0 20 \u2032 -6 \u00b0 40 \u2032 Cancer ) , Artha p\u0101da ( 6 \u00b0 40 \u2032 -10 \u00b0 00 \u2032 Cancer ) , K\u0101ma p\u0101da ( 10 \u00b0 00 \u2032 -13 \u00b0 20 \u2032 Cancer ) , and Mok\u1e63a p\u0101da ( 13 \u00b0 20 \u2032 -16 \u00b0 40 \u2032 Cancer ) . Since Jupiter is exalted at 5 \u00b0 Cancer this signifies `` deep '' exaltation in the heart of the Dharma p\u0101da of Pushya Nakshatra in the sign of Cancer which provides the astronomical reasoning of Jupiters exaltation degree . Esoterically speaking , when Jupiter is in Cancer ( which signifies the heart ) , and is being influenced by B\u1e5bhaspati ( the teacher of the Gods ) , and is directed toward righteous action ( Dharma p\u0101da ) Jupiter is functioning in 100 % exaltation , concerning everything Jupiter represents .   The sign position directly opposite a planet 's sign of exaltation is considered to be its fall . As the exaltation is a place of awareness for the planet , the `` fall '' is a position of weakness concerning the function of the planet , including everything else the planet represents .",

      "A geological fold occurs when one or a stack of originally flat and planar surfaces , such as sedimentary strata , are bent or curved as a result of permanent deformation . Synsedimentary folds are those due to slumping of sedimentary material before it is lithified . Folds in rocks vary in size from microscopic crinkles to mountain-sized folds . They occur singly as isolated folds and in extensive fold trains of different sizes , on a variety of scales .   Folds form under varied conditions of stress , hydrostatic pressure , pore pressure , and temperature gradient , as evidenced by their presence in soft sediments , the full spectrum of metamorphic rocks , and even as primary flow structures in some igneous rocks . A set of folds distributed on a regional scale constitutes a fold belt , a common feature of orogenic zones . Folds are commonly formed by shortening of existing layers , but may also be formed as a result of displacement on a non-planar fault ( fault bend fold ) , at the tip of a propagating fault ( fault propagation fold ) , by differential compaction or due to the effects of a high-level igneous intrusion e.g. above a laccolith .",

      "The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 ( NCLB ) was a U.S. Act of Congress that reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act ; it included Title I provisions applying to disadvantaged students . It supported standards-based education reform based on the premise that setting high standards and establishing measurable goals could improve individual outcomes in education . The Act required states to develop assessments in basic skills . To receive federal school funding , states had to give these assessments to all students at select grade levels .   The act did not assert a national achievement standard -- each state developed its own standards . NCLB expanded the federal role in public education through further emphasis on annual testing , annual academic progress , report cards , and teacher qualifications , as well as significant changes in funding .   The bill passed in the Congress with bipartisan support . By 2015 , criticism from right , left , and center had accumulated so much that a bipartisan Congress stripped away the national features of No Child Left Behind . Its replacement , the Every Student Succeeds Act , turned the remnants over to the states .",

Officially , it is the Father Louis Hennepin Bridge , in honor of the 17th-century explorer Louis Hennepin , who was the first European to see the Saint Anthony Falls , a short distance downriver . Two of the three previous structures have been suspension bridges , while a third -- which existed nearly a century -- was composed of steel arch spans . The original crossing , which opened as a toll bridge on January 23 , 1855 , is believed to have been the first permanent span across the Mississippi at any point . Other bridges were completed in 1876 , 1891 , and most recently 1990 . Today , the bridge 's main span is 190 m in length , making it rather small by modern standards .",

His second novel , Midnight 's Children ( 1981 ) , won the Booker Prize in 1981 and was deemed to be `` the best novel of all winners '' on two separate occasions , marking the 25th and the 40th anniversary of the prize . Much of his fiction is set on the Indian subcontinent . He combines magical realism with historical fiction ; his work is concerned with the many connections , disruptions , and migrations between Eastern and Western civilizations .   His epic fourth novel , The Satanic Verses ( 1988 ) , was the subject of a major controversy , provoking protests from Muslims in several countries . Death threats were made against him , including a fatw\u0101 calling for his assassination issued by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , the Supreme Leader of Iran , on 14 February 1989 . The British government put Rushdie under police protection .   In 1983 Rushdie was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature , the UK 's senior literary organisation .

He was named Distinguished Writer in Residence at the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute of New York University in 2015 . Earlier , he taught at Emory University . He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters . In 2012 , he published Joseph Anton : A Memoir , an account of his life in the wake of the controversy over The Satanic Verses .

      "The Lehigh Canal or Lehigh Navigation was a ` navigation ' , the type of canal built along the line of a river and parallel to the fall of the watercourse , constructed in two parts -- a lower and an upper section built over a span of twenty years from 1818 . Sections of it were engineered to bypass rapids in the Lehigh River in Eastern Pennsylvania . The canal moved Allegheny anthracite coal to the cities of the coast and ran to an eventual length of 72 mi . At its terminus , other entities would scramble to build canals and railroads to distribute the ` fuel of choice of the day ' to all the Eastern Seaboard of America and ocean going ships . Anthracite would not only banish the worries of the nation 's first energy crises as deforestation raised firewood and fuel prices and incurred ever increasing transportation costs , but also make iron plentiful , revolutionizing materials and machinery in hundreds of cumulative innovations as White and his associates brought Anthracite pig iron smelting into being and made the Lehigh Valley a major iron production center -- the leading production region in iron and steel production for decades .",
      "A post-office box or post office box ( commonly referred to as a P.O. box or a postal box ) is a uniquely addressable lockable box located on the premises of a post office station .   In many regions , particularly in Africa and the Middle East , there is no ` door to door ' delivery of mail , for example , in Kenya . Consequently , renting a PO box has traditionally been the only way to receive mail in such countries . However , some , like Jordan , have introduced mail home delivery .   Generally , post office boxes are rented from the post office either by individuals or by businesses on a basis ranging from monthly to annual , and the cost of rent varies depending on the box size . Central business district ( CBD ) PO boxes are usually more expensive than rural PO boxes .   In the United States , the rental rate used to be uniform across the country . Now , however , a postal facility can be in any of seven fee groups by location ; in addition , certain customers qualify for free box rental , usually because the Postal Service does n't offer carrier-route delivery to their physical addresses .   In the United Kingdom , Royal Mail PO boxes are often little more than pigeon-holes in the secure section of a sorting office , and are accessible only by staff . In such cases , the renter of the PO box will be issued with a card showing the PO box number and delivery office name , and must produce this to the desk staff when collecting mail . For an additional fee , the Royal Mail will deliver received items to the renter 's geographical address .   Some private companies ( e.g. , United Parcel Service ( UPS ) and commercial mail receiving agencies , also offer similar services of renting a mailbox in a public location . The difference with an official PO box is that mail sent there is addressed to a street address ( along with the box number ) , instead of just addressed to `` PO Box CSX '' .",

It owns , leases , operates , has booking rights for and/or equity interests in a large number of U.S. entertainment venues . The leadership consists of Greg Maffei ( chief executive officer of Liberty Media ) as chairman and Canadian Michael Rapino ( previously chief executive officer of Live Nation ) as president and CEO of the company .   The merger that formed the company was opposed by members of the United States Congress , business rivals , and the Computer & Communications Industry Association ( CCIA ) , whose members include Google , Oracle , Microsoft , Yahoo , Intuit , and eBay .   The merger initially received regulatory approval in Norway and Turkey in 2009 . In October 2009 , the United Kingdom 's Competition Commission provisionally ruled against the merger . On December 22 , 2009 , the Competition Commission reversed its decision and cleared the proposed merger . The United States Justice Department approved the merger on January 25 , 2010 , with some conditions to which both parties agreed .   As part of the agreement with governments to merge , Ticketmaster had to sell its ownership in its self-ticketing company , Paciolan and Live Nation Entertainment was placed under a 10-year court order prohibiting it from retaliating against venues that choose to accept competitors ' ticket-selling contracts , and it `` must allow venues that sign deals elsewhere to take consumer ticketing data with them '' .   In addition , the new company had to license a copy of its ticketing software to two companies -- Anschutz Entertainment Group ( AEG ) and either Comcast Spectacor or another `` suitable '' company -- so that both companies could compete `` head-to-head '' with Ticketmaster for venues ' business . AEG was given the option after five years to buy the software , replacing it with something else , or partnering with another ticketing company .

      "Coeliac disease , also spelled celiac disease , is a long term autoimmune disorder primarily affecting the small intestine that occurs in people who are genetically predisposed . Classic symptoms include gastrointestinal problems such as chronic diarrhoea , abdominal distention , malabsorption , loss of appetite , and among children failure to grow normally . This often begins between six months and two years of age . Non-classic symptoms are more common , especially in people older than two years . There may be mild or absent gastrointestinal symptoms , a wide number of symptoms involving any part of the body , or no obvious symptoms . Coeliac disease was first described in childhood ; however , it may develop at any age . It is associated with other autoimmune diseases , such as diabetes mellitus type 1 and thyroiditis , among others .   Coeliac disease is caused by a reaction to gluten , which are various proteins found in wheat and in other grains such as barley , and rye . Moderate quantities of oats , free of contamination with other gluten-containing grains , are usually tolerated . The occurrence of problems may depend on the variety of oat . Upon exposure to gluten , an abnormal immune response may lead to the production of several different autoantibodies that can affect a number of different organs . In the small-bowel this causes an inflammatory reaction and may produce shortening of the villi lining the small intestine ( villous atrophy ) . This affects the absorption of nutrients , frequently leading to anaemia .   Diagnosis is typically made by a combination of blood antibody tests and intestinal biopsies , helped by specific genetic testing . Making the diagnosis is not always straightforward . Frequently , the autoantibodies in the blood are negative and many people have only minor intestinal changes with normal villi . People may have severe symptoms and be investigated for years before a diagnosis is achieved . Increasingly , the diagnosis is being made in people without symptoms as a result of screening . Evidence regarding the effects of screening , however , is not sufficient to determine its usefulness . While the disease is caused by a permanent intolerance to wheat proteins , it is not a form of wheat allergy .   The only known effective treatment is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet , which leads to recovery of the intestinal mucosa , improves symptoms , and reduces risk of developing complications in most people . If untreated , it may result in cancers such as intestinal lymphoma and a slight increased risk of early death . Rates vary between different regions of the world , from as few as 1 in 300 to as many as 1 in 40 , with an average of between 1 in 100 and 1 in 170 people . In developed countries , it is estimated that five out of six cases ( 83 % ) remain undiagnosed , usually because of non-classic , minimal , or absent complaints . Coeliac disease is slightly more common in women than in men . The term `` coeliac '' is from the Greek \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ( koiliak\u00f3s , `` abdominal '' ) and was introduced in the 19th century in a translation of what is generally regarded as an ancient Greek description of the disease by Aretaeus of Cappadocia ."

He is principally remembered for his military campaigns against Babylon and Judah , and for his building programs -- most notably at the Akkadian capital of Nineveh . He was assassinated in obscure circumstances in 681 BCE , apparently by his eldest son ( his designated successor , Esarhaddon , was the youngest ) .   The primary preoccupation of his reign was the so-called `` Babylonian problem '' , the refusal of the Babylonians to accept Assyrian rule , culminating in his destruction of the city in 689 BCE . Further campaigns were carried out in Syria ( notable for being recorded in the Bible 's Books of Kings , ) in the mountains east of Assyria , against the kingdoms of Anatolia and against the Arabs in the northern Arabian deserts . His death was welcomed in Babylon as divine punishment for the destruction of that city .   He was also a notable builder : it was under him that Assyrian art reached its peak . His building projects included the beautification of Nineveh , a canal 50 km long to bring water to the city , and the `` Palace Without Rival '' , which included what may have been the prototype of the legendary Hanging Gardens of Babylon , or even the actual Hanging Gardens ."

      "The Battle of Britain ( German : die Luftschlacht um England , literally `` the air battle for England '' ) was a military campaign of the Second World War , when the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) defended the United Kingdom ( UK ) against the German Air Force ( Luftwaffe ) attacks from the end of June 1940 . It is described as the first major campaign fought entirely by air forces . The British officially recognise its duration as from 10 July until 31 October 1940 , which overlaps with the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz , while German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard it as a campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941 .   The primary objective of the Nazi German forces was to compel Britain to agree to a negotiated peace settlement . In July 1940 , the air and sea blockade began with the Luftwaffe mainly targeting coastal shipping convoys , ports and shipping centres , such as Portsmouth . On 1 August , the Luftwaffe was directed to achieve air superiority over the RAF with the aim of incapacitating RAF Fighter Command ; 12 days later , it shifted the attacks to RAF airfields and infrastructure . As the battle progressed , the Luftwaffe also targeted factories involved in aircraft production and strategic infrastructure and , eventually , it employed terror bombing on areas of political significance and civilians .   The Germans had swiftly overwhelmed continental countries , and Britain now appeared to face the same threat of invasion , but the German high command knew the difficulties of an unprecedented seaborne attack , and its impracticality while the Royal Navy commanded the seas . On 16 July Hitler ordered the preparation of Operation Sea Lion as a potential amphibious and airborne assault on Britain , to follow once the Luftwaffe had air superiority over the UK . In September German preparation of converted barges was disrupted by RAF Bomber Command night raids , and the Luftwaffe failure to overwhelm the RAF forced Hitler to postpone and eventually cancel Operation Sea Lion .   Nazi Germany was unable to sustain daylight raids , but their continued night bombing operations on Britain became known as the Blitz . The failure to destroy Britain 's air defences to force an armistice ( or even outright surrender ) is considered by Steven Bungay to be the first major defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II , and a crucial turning point in the conflict .   The Battle of Britain takes its name from a speech by Winston Churchill to the House of Commons on 18 June : `` What General Weygand has called The Battle of France is over . The Battle of Britain is about to begin . ''",

      "Netscape Navigator is a discontinued proprietary web browser , and the original browser of the Netscape line , from versions 1 to 4.08 , and 9.x . It was the flagship product of the Netscape Communications Corp and was the dominant web browser in terms of usage share in the 1990s , but by 2002 its usage had almost disappeared . This was primarily due to the increased usage of Microsoft 's Internet Explorer web browser software , and partly because the Netscape Corporation ( later purchased by AOL ) did not sustain Netscape Navigator 's technical innovation after the late 1990s .   The business demise of Netscape was a central premise of Microsoft 's antitrust trial , wherein the Court ruled that Microsoft Corporation 's bundling of Internet Explorer with the Windows operating system was a monopolistic and illegal business practice . The decision came too late for Netscape , however , as Internet Explorer had by then become the dominant web browser in Windows .   The Netscape Navigator web browser was succeeded by the Netscape Communicator suite in 1997 . Netscape Communicator 's 4.x source code was the base for the Netscape-developed Mozilla Application Suite , which was later renamed SeaMonkey . Netscape 's Mozilla Suite also served as the base for a browser-only spinoff called Mozilla Firefox .   The Netscape Navigator name returned in 2007 when AOL announced version 9 of the Netscape series of browsers , Netscape Navigator 9 .

      "The dodo ( Raphus cucullatus ) is an extinct flightless bird that was endemic to the island of Mauritius , east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean . The dodo 's closest genetic relative was the also extinct Rodrigues solitaire , the two forming the subfamily Raphinae of the family of pigeons and doves . The closest living relative of the dodo is the Nicobar pigeon . A white dodo was once thought to have existed on the nearby island of R\u00e9union , but this is now thought to have been confusion based on the R\u00e9union ibis and paintings of white dodos .   Subfossil remains show the dodo was about 1 m tall and may have weighed 10.6 - . The dodo 's appearance in life is evidenced only by drawings , paintings , and written accounts from the 17th century . Because these vary considerably , and because only some illustrations are known to have been drawn from live specimens , its exact appearance in life remains unresolved , and little is known about its behaviour . Though the dodo has historically been considered fat and clumsy , it is now thought to have been well-adapted for its ecosystem . It has been depicted with brownish-grey plumage , yellow feet , a tuft of tail feathers , a grey , naked head , and a black , yellow , and green beak . It used gizzard stones to help digest its food , which is thought to have included fruits , and its main habitat is believed to have been the woods in the drier coastal areas of Mauritius . One account states its clutch consisted of a single egg . It is presumed that the dodo became flightless because of the ready availability of abundant food sources and a relative absence of predators on Mauritius .   The first recorded mention of the dodo was by Dutch sailors in 1598 . In the following years , the bird was hunted by sailors and invasive species , while its habitat was being destroyed . The last widely accepted sighting of a dodo was in 1662 . Its extinction was not immediately noticed , and some considered it to be a mythical creature . In the 19th century , research was conducted on a small quantity of remains of four specimens that had been brought to Europe in the early 17th century . Among these is a dried head , the only soft tissue of the dodo that remains today . Since then , a large amount of subfossil material has been collected on Mauritius , mostly from the Mare aux Songes swamp . The extinction of the dodo within less than a century of its discovery called attention to the previously unrecognised problem of human involvement in the disappearance of entire species . The dodo achieved widespread recognition from its role in the story of Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland , and it has since become a fixture in popular culture , often as a symbol of extinction and obsolescence .",

      "Hurricane Hattie was the strongest and deadliest tropical cyclone of the 1961 Atlantic hurricane season , reaching a peak intensity equivalent to that of a Category 5 hurricane . The ninth tropical storm and seventh hurricane and major hurricane of the season , Hattie originated from an area of low pressure that strengthened into a tropical storm over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on October 27 . Moving generally northward , the storm quickly became a hurricane and later major hurricane the following day . Hattie then turned westward west of Jamaica and strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane , with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph . It weakened to Category 4 before making landfall south of Belize City on October 31 . The storm turned southwestward and weakened rapidly over the mountainous terrain of Central America , dissipating on November 1 .   Hattie first affected the southwestern Caribbean , where it produced hurricane-force winds and caused one death on San Andres Island . It was initially forecast to continue north and strike Cuba , prompting evacuations on the island . While turning west , Hattie dropped heavy rainfall of up to 11.5 in on Grand Cayman . The country of Belize , at the time known as British Honduras , sustained the worst damage from the hurricane . The former capital , Belize City , was buffeted by strong winds and flooded by a powerful storm surge . The territory governor estimated that 70 % of the buildings in the city had been damaged , leaving more than 10,000 people homeless . The destruction was so severe that it prompted the government to relocate inland to a new city , Belmopan . Overall , Hattie caused about $ 60 million in losses and 307 deaths in the territory . Although damage was heavier in Hattie than a hurricane in 1931 that killed 2,000 people , the death toll from Hattie was less due to advance warnings . Elsewhere in Central America , Hattie killed 11 people in Guatemala and one in Honduras .",

      "Trick-or-treating is a Halloween custom for children in many countries . Children in costumes travel from house to house asking for treats such as candy ( or , in some cultures , money ) with the phrase `` Trick or treat '' . The `` trick '' is a ( usually idle ) threat to perform mischief on the homeowners or their property if no treat is given to them .  It typically happens during the evening of October 31 . Some homeowners signal that they are willing to hand out treats , for example by putting up Halloween decorations outside their door . Others might simply leave treats on their porch .   In North America , trick-or-treating has been a Halloween tradition since the late 1920s . In Britain and Ireland the tradition of going house-to-house collecting food at Halloween goes back at least as far as the 16th century , as had the tradition of people wearing costumes at Halloween . In 19th century Britain and Ireland , there are many accounts of people going house-to-house in costume at Halloween , reciting verses in exchange for food , and sometimes warning of misfortune if they were not welcomed . The Scottish Halloween custom of `` guising '' -- children disguised in costume going from house to house for food or money -- is first recorded in North America in 1911 . While going house-to-house in costume has remained popular among Scots and Irish , the custom of saying `` trick or treat '' has only recently become common . The activity is prevalent in the United States , Canada , the United Kingdom , the Republic of Ireland , Puerto Rico , and northwestern and central Mexico . In the latter , this practice is called calaverita ( Spanish for `` little skull '' ) , and instead of `` trick or treat '' , the children ask \u00bf me da mi calaverita ? ( `` can you give me my little skull ? '' ) where a calaverita is a small skull made of sugar or chocolate .",

      "The Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua ( AMLQ , Highest Academy of the Quechua Language ; Quechua : Qheswa simi hamut ` ana kuraq suntur ) is a private institution in Cusco , founded in 1990 , concerned with the `` purity '' of Quechua .   The AMLQ takes the point of view that there is only one single Quechua language and that the present Quechua of the city of Cusco , with all its regional peculiarities ( and not any intermediate form like Southern Quechua ) should be the official standard for all Quechua ; it uses the term `` Inka Quechua '' ( quechua inka or inka qheswa ) to refer to present-day Cusco Quechua . The AMLQ vehemently promotes the old Quechua alphabet established by the Peruvian government in 1975 , which corresponds mostly to the current alphabet fixed in 1985 , but by contrast contains the five vowels a , e , i , o , u.   The AMLQ refers to a law ( No 25260 ) passed by the Peruvian Congress on June 6 , 1990 , establishing a Quechua language academy in the city of Cusco . However , it gets almost no money at all from the State , and because its opinions on orthography are counter to those of the Peruvian Education Ministry and almost all linguists and professionals working in Quechua education , the Academy has had little real involvement in this .   For a number of reasons , the AMLQ has generally hostile and very poor relationships with most linguists working on Quechua , who have often heavily criticised its approach .",

It was founded as an association in 1871 by a small circle of composers and musicians around the composer Peter Heise with the purpose of promoting and preserving Danish music . In 1887 , after a big decrease in the number of members of the association , the Society decided to publish primarily new music , and this has been the focus ever since . Carl Nielsen , one of Denmark 's greatest composers , was a member of the Board from 1899 to his death in 1931 and had a number of works published through the Society before as well as after his death .   In 2011 the publishing house changed its name to Edition S -- music \u00ac sound \u00ac art , which was pronounceable for non-Danes as well . This was to accommodate the international scene for new art music that showed an increasing interest in Danish composers .   Edition S has since 1890 been supported financially by the state . The company was restructured and became a private trust in 2007 , but the state support is still the main source enabling Edition S to carry on its activity ."

      "The Battle of the Trebia ( or Trebbia ) was the first major battle of the Second Punic War , fought between the Carthaginian forces of Hannibal and the Roman Republic in December of 218 BC , on or around the winter solstice . It was a resounding Roman defeat with heavy losses , and yet some 10,000 and more Romans , over 2.5 legions , survived on the field and retreated in order to Placentia ( Piacenza ) . In this battle , Hannibal got the better of the Romans by exercising the careful and innovative planning for which he was famous . The impetuous and short-sighted opposing general , the consul Tiberius Sempronius Longus , allowed himself to be provoked into a frontal assault under physically difficult circumstances and failed to see that he was being led into a trap .   The battle took place in the flat country of the Province of Piacenza on the left bank of the Trebbia River , a shallow , braided stream , not far south from its confluence ( from the south ) with the Po river . The battle is named for the river . Although the precise location is not known for certain , it is generally accepted as being visible from the Via Emilia , now paralleled by highway A21/E70 and a railroad trunk line , all of which come from Piacenza , a contemporaneously placed Roman colony ( though perhaps on an existing settlement ) , and cross the river north of where the Romans did in the battle . The area is possibly in the comune of Rottofreno at its main settlement , San Nicol\u00f2 a Trebbia , in the vicinity of the coordinates given at the head of this article.Over the course of more than two millennia the precise configuration of the Trebbia and its streams as well as that of the Po have changed geologically . Although the location of Placentia is believed to be roughly the same , the original surfaces are under new layers of sediment and the locations of the bends , the depths and widths of the streams all have changed . Construction in the area also has been extensive , not to mention the turning over of the soil and obliteration of features by heavy bombing when the bridges and rail lines were destroyed in World War II . The Trebbia and the Po are currently heavily diked .",

Translation-invariance is achieved by removing the downsamplers and upsamplers in the DWT and upsampling the filter coefficients by a factor of in the th level of the algorithm . The SWT is an inherently redundant scheme as the output of each level of SWT contains the same number of samples as the input -- so for a decomposition of N levels there is a redundancy of N in the wavelet coefficients .

      "The Apache Trail in Arizona was a stagecoach trail that ran through the Superstition Mountains . It was named the Apache Trail after the Apache Indians who originally used this trail to move through the Superstition Mountains .   The current Apache Trail links Apache Junction at the edge of the Greater Phoenix area with Theodore Roosevelt Lake through the Superstition Mountains and the Tonto National Forest .   Today , the majority of Apache Trail remains unpaved , turning into a dirt road a few miles up from Tortilla Flat , and continuing as such for nearly the full remainder of its length . The section east of Apache Junction is known officially as State Route 88 . It is also the main traffic corridor through Apache Junction , turning into Main Street as the road passes into Mesa , and regains the Apache name by becoming Apache Boulevard in Tempe , ending at Mill Avenue . Prior to the completion of the Superstition Freeway in 1992 , the Apache Junction portion of the Apache Trail was part of US Highway 60 , which was rerouted to the Superstition Freeway once it was completed .   The Trail winds steeply through 40 mi of rugged desert mountains , past deep reservoir lakes like Canyon Lake and Apache Lake . The narrow , winding road is unpaved from just east of the town of Tortilla Flat to Roosevelt Dam ; there are steep cliff drops and little in the way of safety barriers . The trail requires caution when driving and it is not recommended for large RVs , SUVs , or caravans .

The original Semitic base ( Siculo-Arabic ) comprises around one-third of the Maltese vocabulary , especially words that denote basic ideas and the function words , but about half of the vocabulary is derived from standard Italian and Sicilian ; and English words make up between 6 % and 20 % of the vocabulary .

      "Rule-based machine learning ( RBML ) is a term in computer science intended to encompass any machine learning method that identifies , learns , or evolves ` rules ' to store , manipulate or apply . The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learner is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system . This is in contrast to other machine learners that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction .   Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems , association rule learning , artificial immune systems , and any other method that relies on a set of rules , each covering contextual knowledge .   While rule-based machine learning is conceptually a type of rule-based system , it is distinct from traditional rule-based systems , which are often hand-crafted , and other rule-based decision makers . This is because rule-based machine learning applies some form of learning algorithm to automatically identify useful rules , rather than a human needing to apply prior domain knowledge to manually construct rules and curate a rule set .",

      "Pocahontas ( born Matoaka , known as Amonute , 1596 -- 1617 ) was a Native American woman notable for her association with the colonial settlement at Jamestown , Virginia . Pocahontas was the daughter of Powhatan , the paramount chief of a network of tributary tribal nations in the Tsenacommacah , encompassing the Tidewater region of Virginia . In a well-known historical anecdote , she is said to have saved the life of a captive of the Native Americans , the Englishman John Smith , in 1607 by placing her head upon his own when her father raised his war club to execute him . Some historians have suggested that this story , as told by Smith , is untrue .   Pocahontas was captured by the English during Anglo-Indian hostilities in 1613 , and held for ransom . During her captivity , she converted to Christianity and took the name Rebecca . When the opportunity arose for her to return to her people , she chose to remain with the English . In April 1614 , she married tobacco planter John Rolfe , and in January 1615 , bore their son , Thomas Rolfe .   In 1616 , the Rolfes traveled to London . Pocahontas was presented to English society as an example of the `` civilized savage '' in hopes of stimulating investment in the Jamestown settlement . She became something of a celebrity , was elegantly f\u00eated , and attended a masque at Whitehall Palace . In 1617 , the Rolfes set sail for Virginia , but Pocahontas died at Gravesend of unknown causes . She was buried in a church in Gravesend in the United Kingdom , but the exact location of her grave is unknown .   Numerous places , landmarks , and products in the United States have been named after Pocahontas . Her story has been romanticized over the years , and she is a subject of art , literature , and film . Many famous people have claimed to be among her descendants through her son Thomas , including members of the First Families of Virginia , First Lady Edith Wilson , American Western actor Glenn Strange , and astronomer Percival Lowell .",

      "Ecopreneurship is a term coined to represent the process of principles of entrepreneurship being applied to create businesses that solve environmental problems or operate sustainably . The term began to be widely used in the 1990s , and it is otherwise referred to as `` environmental entrepreneurship . '' In the book Merging Economic and Environmental Concerns Through Ecopreneurship , written by Gwyn Schuyler in 1998 , ecopreneurs are defined as follows : `` Ecopreneurs are entrepreneurs whose business efforts are not only driven by profit , but also by a concern for the environment . Ecopreneurship , also known as environmental entrepreneurship and eco-capitalism , is becoming more widespread as a new market-based approach to identifying opportunities for improving environmental quality and capitalizing upon them in the private sector for profit . `` Although ecopreneurship initiatives can span a wide range of issues from ocean pollution to recycling to food waste , they tend to follow reoccurring environmental principles such as systems thinking , cradle to cradle product design , triple bottom line accounting , etc. .",

      "The Rheinmetall Oerlikon Millennium Gun or Rheinmetall GDM-008 is a Close-in weapon system designed by Rheinmetall Air Defence AG ( formerly known as Oerlikon Contraves ) for mounting on ships . It is based on the 35/1000 revolver gun land based air defense system , and uses AHEAD ammunition .   A device at the muzzle end of the barrel measures the exact speed of each round as it is fired , and automatically sets the fuse to detonate the round as it approaches a pre-set distance from the target . Each round disperses 152 small tungsten projectiles to strike the incoming target . Whilst these are too small to do major damage in themselves , the accumulation of damage from multiple strikes is expected to destroy wings and control surfaces , sensors and aerodynamics , causing the target to crash . Other firing modes are designed to be effective against surface targets such as small fast attack boats .   The Millennium gun is easy to install as it requires no through deck penetration and needs no supply of coolant , air or ship 's power to operate . However , it does need a power supply to recharge its batteries . Installation can take as little as sixty minutes and requires only six square metres of deck space . A Millennium gun and 252 rounds weighs 3,200 kg . The gun 's cupola is claimed to have a low radar cross section .   The weapon is designed to be controlled by an external fire-control system using either radar or electro-optical trackers . It is fitted with an optional onboard observation TV camera which relays imagery to an operator console from which it can also be aimed and fired in an emergency mode . The computer system uses an open architecture and is claimed to be compatible with many existing fire control systems ."

      "The Gettysburg Address is a speech by U.S. President Abraham Lincoln , one of the best-known in American history . It was delivered by Lincoln during the American Civil War , on the afternoon of Thursday , November 19 , 1863 , at the dedication of the Soldiers ' National Cemetery in Gettysburg , Pennsylvania , four and a half months after the Union armies defeated those of the Confederacy at the Battle of Gettysburg .   Abraham Lincoln 's carefully crafted address , secondary to other presentations that day , was one of the greatest and most influential statements of national purpose . In just over two minutes , Lincoln reiterated the principles of human equality espoused by the Declaration of Independence and proclaimed the Civil War as a struggle for the preservation of the Union sundered by the secession crisis , with `` a new birth of freedom '' that would bring true equality to all of its citizens . Lincoln also redefined the Civil War as a struggle not just for the Union , but also for the principle of human equality .   Beginning with the now-iconic phrase `` Four score and seven years ago '' -- referring to the United States Declaration of Independence in 1776 -- Lincoln examined the founding principles of the United States as stated in the Declaration of Independence . In the context of the Civil War , Lincoln also memorialized the sacrifices of those who gave their lives at Gettysburg and extolled virtues for the listeners ( and the nation ) to ensure the survival of America 's representative democracy : that `` government of the people , by the people , for the people , shall not perish from the earth . ''   Despite the speech 's prominent place in the history and popular culture of the United States , the exact wording and location of the speech are disputed . The five known manuscripts of the Gettysburg Address in Lincoln 's hand differ in a number of details , and also differ from contemporary newspaper reprints of the speech . Modern scholarship locates the speakers ' platform 40 yards ( or more ) away from the Traditional Site within Soldiers ' National Cemetery at the Soldiers ' National Monument and entirely within private , adjacent Evergreen Cemetery .",

During the early history of the University of Cambridge , the title professor simply denoted a doctor who taught in the university , a usage that continues to be found in , for example , US universities . However , from the 16th century onwards in Cambridge it was used to denote those holding `` chairs '' that had been founded by the university in a particular subject or endowed by a benefaction .   On occasion the University of Cambridge creates professorships for the benefit of a single individual , the chair ceasing to exist when that individual resigns , dies , or retires . These `` personal '' professorships limited to one tenure are not listed here .   The Regius Professorships are `` royal '' professorships , being created by the reigning monarch . The first five Regius Professorships , sometimes referred to as the Henrician Regius Professors , were granted arms and crests in 1590 .

She was the sovereign of Austria , Hungary , Croatia , Bohemia , Transylvania , Mantua , Milan , Lodomeria and Galicia , the Austrian Netherlands and Parma . By marriage , she was Duchess of Lorraine , Grand Duchess of Tuscany and Holy Roman Empress .   She started her 40-year reign when her father , Emperor Charles VI , died in October 1740 . Charles VI paved the way for her accession with the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 and spent his entire reign securing it . Upon the death of her father , Saxony , Prussia , Bavaria , and France all repudiated the sanction they had recognised during his lifetime . Frederick II of Prussia ( who became Maria Theresa 's greatest enemy for most of her reign ) promptly invaded and took the affluent Habsburg province of Silesia in the nine-year conflict known as the War of the Austrian Succession . Over the course of the war , despite the loss of Silesia and a few minor territories in Italy , Maria Theresa successfully defended her rule over most of the Habsburg empire . Maria Theresa later unsuccessfully tried to reconquer Silesia during the Seven Years ' War .   Maria Theresa and her husband , Francis I , Holy Roman Emperor , had eleven daughters , including the Queen of France and Navarre , the Queen of Naples and Sicily , the Duchess of Parma , and five sons , including two Holy Roman Emperors , Joseph II and Leopold II . Of the sixteen children ten survived to adulthood . Though she was expected to cede power to Francis and Joseph , both of whom were officially her co-rulers in Austria and Bohemia , Maria Theresa was the absolute sovereign who ruled with the counsel of her advisers . She criticised and disapproved of many of Joseph 's actions . Maria Theresa understood the importance of her public persona and was able to simultaneously evoke both esteem and affection from her subjects .   Maria Theresa promulgated financial and educational reforms , with the assistance of Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Haugwitz and Gerard van Swieten , promoted commerce and the development of agriculture , and reorganised Austria 's ramshackle military , all of which strengthened Austria 's international standing . However , she refused to allow religious pluralism and advocated for the state church and contemporary adversary travelers criticized her regime as bigoted and superstitious . As a young monarch who fought two dynastic wars , she believed that her cause should be the cause of her subjects , but in her later years she would believe that their cause must be hers .",

      "Over-the-counter ( OTC ) drugs are medicines sold directly to a consumer without a prescription from a healthcare professional , as opposed to prescription drugs , which may only be sold to consumers possessing a valid prescription . In many countries , OTC drugs are selected by a regulatory agency to ensure that they are ingredients that are safe and effective when used without a physician 's care . OTC drugs are usually regulated by active pharmaceutical ingredients ( APIs ) , not final products . By regulating APIs instead of specific drug formulations , governments allow manufacturers freedom to formulate ingredients , or combinations of ingredients , into proprietary mixtures .   The term over-the-counter may be somewhat counterintuitive , since , in many countries , these drugs are often placed on shelves in self-service areas of stores , like any other packaged products . In contrast , prescription drugs are almost always passed over a counter from the pharmacist to the customer . Some drugs may be legally classified as over-the-counter ( i.e. no prescription is required ) , but may only be dispensed by a pharmacist after an assessment of the patient 's needs or the provision of patient education . In many countries , a number of OTC drugs are available in establishments without a pharmacy , such as general stores , supermarkets , and gas stations .

He is best known for his 1818 work The World as Will and Representation ( expanded in 1844 ) , wherein he characterizes the phenomenal world as the product of a blind and insatiable metaphysical will . Proceeding from the transcendental idealism of Immanuel Kant , Schopenhauer developed an atheistic metaphysical and ethical system that has been described as an exemplary manifestation of philosophical pessimism , rejecting the contemporaneous post-Kantian philosophies of German idealism . Schopenhauer was among the first thinkers in Western philosophy to share and affirm significant tenets of Eastern philosophy ( e.g. , asceticism , the world-as-appearance ) , having initially arrived at similar conclusions as the result of his own philosophical work . His writing on aesthetics , morality , and psychology would exert important influence on thinkers and artists throughout the 19th and 20th centuries .   Though his work failed to garner substantial attention during his life , Schopenhauer has had a posthumous impact across various disciplines , including philosophy , literature , and science . Those who have cited his influence include Friedrich Nietzsche , Richard Wagner , Leo Tolstoy , Ludwig Wittgenstein , Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger , Otto Rank , Gustav Mahler , Joseph Campbell , Albert Einstein , Carl Jung , Thomas Mann , Jorge Luis Borges , and Samuel Beckett , among others .",

The film stars Charlotte Gainsbourg , Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd , Stacy Martin , Shia LaBeouf , Christian Slater , Jamie Bell , Uma Thurman , Willem Dafoe and Connie Nielsen . The film was originally supposed to be only one complete entry ; but , because of its multiple hour length , von Trier made the decision to split the project into two separate films . Nymphomaniac was an international co-production of Denmark , Belgium , France , and Germany .   The world premiere of the uncut version of `` Volume I '' of the original five-and-half-hour-long version occurred on 16 February 2014 at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival . The world premiere of the uncut version of `` Volume II '' debuted at 2014 's Venice Film Festival . A `` secret '' advance screening of Part I occurred at the Sundance Film Festival on 21 January 2014 , at the Egyptian Theater with tickets distributed bearing the film title `` Film X '' amidst rumors the film could either be von Trier 's film , or Wes Anderson 's The Grand Budapest Hotel .

The team posted a losing record for the second-consecutive season , and missed the postseason for the third season .   Buffalo started the season with four consecutive losses , and failed to win consecutive games . The team was shut out two times at home . The Bills beat only one team with a winning record -- the New England Patriots , in an early November game in Foxboro that ultimately proved fatal to the Patriots ' playoff hopes .   After drawing 76,000 to Rich Stadium on opening day against the Dolphins , Buffalo drew an average of only 35,000 for the remaining 6 home games .   The Bills had one of the most pass-heavy offenses in the NFL in 1977 . Quarterback Joe Ferguson led the league in pass attempts ( 457 , 32.6 per game ) and passing yards ( 2,803 , 200.2 per game ) . He also threw 24 interceptions , the most in the NFL .   Although the Bills passed the ball more often than any other team , they were not efficient through the air : they ranked 19th in passing touchdowns , 21st in yards per attempt , and 20th in quarterback rating ( a dismal 54.7 ) . Buffalo 's 160 points scored was the third-worst in the NFL .   Buffalo 's defense also gave up 313 points , the fourth-worst total in the league . Buffalo 's anemic scoring and porous defense gave the team a point-differential of \u2212 153 , dead-last in the league . This was the last season for O.J.

      "The Sands Hotel and Casino was a historic hotel and casino on the Las Vegas Strip in Nevada , United States , that operated from 1952 to 1996 . Designed by the architect Wayne McAllister , with a prominent 56 ft high sign , the Sands was the seventh resort to open on the Strip . During its heyday , the Sands was the center of entertainment and `` cool '' on the Strip , and hosted many famous entertainers of the day , most notably the Rat Pack .   The hotel was established in 1952 by Texan oil tycoon Jake Freedman , who bought up the LaRue Restaurant , which had opened two years earlier . The hotel was opened on December 15 , 1952 as a casino with 200 rooms , and was established less than three months after the opening of another notable landmark , Sahara Hotel and Casino . The hotel rooms were divided into four two-story motel wings , each with fifty rooms , and named after famous race tracks . The opening was widely publicized , and every guest was given a Chamois bag with silver dollars . Crime bosses such as Meyer Lansky and Frank Costello acquired shares in the hotel and attracted Frank Sinatra , who made his performing debut at Sands in October 1953 . Sinatra later bought a share in the hotel himself . Sinatra and Sammy Davis , Jr. were instrumental throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s in bringing a change in racial policy in Sands , and after an incident in 1961 , it began employing blacks . In 1960 the classic caper film Ocean 's 11 was shot at the hotel , and it subsequently attained iconic status , with regular performances by Sinatra , Dean Martin , Sammy Davis . Jr. , Red Skelton and others , who performed regularly in the hotel 's world-renowned Copa Room . Much of the musical success of the Copa Room is credited to the room 's band leader and musical conductor Antonio Morelli , whose house orchestra performed in the recording of hundreds of albums over the years .   In the mid 1960s , Sands and its adjacent properties were bought by the reclusive businessman Howard Hughes , who built a 500-room tower and modernized the hotel . After the 1970s it fell into decline until its final owner , Sheldon Adelson , made the decision to shut it down and to build a brand new resort . The last dice in the casino was rolled by Bob Stupak just after 6pm on June 30 , 1996 . On November 26 of that year , it was finally imploded and demolished , much to the dismay of longtime employees and sentimentalists . Today , The Venetian stands where the Sands once stood .",

In addition , it is common to use such term among contemporary and secular Chinese , Hong Kong , and Taiwanese societies typically for a singular universal deity and a non-religion translation for the God in Christianity .",

      "Definition   `` Capability Management '' is the approach to the management of an organization , typically a business organization or firm , based on the `` theory of the firm '' as a collection of capabilities that may be exercised to earn revenues in the marketplace and compete with other firms in the industry . `` Capability Management '' seeks to manage the stock of capabilities within the firm to ensure its position in the industry and its ongoing profitability and survival .   Prior to the emergence of Capability Management , the dominant theory explaining the existence and competitive position of firms , based on Ricardian economics , was the Resource-based view of the firm ( RBVF ) . The fundamental thesis of this theory is that firms derive their profitability from their control of resources - and are in competition to secure control of resources . Perhaps the best-known exposition of the Resource-based View of the Firm is that of one of its key originators : economist Edith Penrose in The Theory of the Growth of the Firm , New York , John Wiley and Sons , 1959 , .   `` Capability Management '' may be regarded as both an extension and alternative to the RBVF that asserts that it is not control over physical resources that is the basis for firm profitability but that `` Companies , like individuals , compete on the basis of their ability to create and utilize knowledge ; ... '' . In short , firms compete not on the basis of control of resources but on the basis of superior Know-How . This Know-How is embedded in the capabilities of the firm - its abilities to do things that are considered valuable ( in and by the market ) .",

      "Pure John Gorka is a `` best of '' collection of John Gorka 's work selected from the five albums Gorka released on the Windham Hill/High Street label between 1990 and 1996 . This collection was released on June 27 , 2006 by Windham Hill ( now owned by Sony/BMG and distributed by Legacy Recordings ) as part of a series of `` Pure '' albums by former Windham Hill artists ; other titles cover the careers of diverse musicians such as Jim Brickman , Mark Isham , Shadowfax , Tuck & Patti , and Will Ackerman .   Gorka says he did n't know anything about this release until he got a call from the copyright department of Sony/BMG : `` I called them back and said , ' I have a record coming out ? ' I found out the story behind it , they 're putting out a series from Windham Hill artists . '' Dawn Atkinson , producer of two of Gorka 's albums , selected the songs . `` It 's hard to describe as a greatest hits thing , '' says Gorka , `` The songs were picked to make a good record upon itself . A best-of , with my favorite songs , that would not make a good record to listen to . My favorites would be too slow . '' Although the collection offers no new recordings to owners of Gorka 's complete back catalog , others will find a few `` gems '' from many of his earlier albums , many of which are no longer in print . These tracks also feature many of the collaborations Gorka has enjoyed over the years . Backing vocalist include Shawn Colvin , Lucy Kaplansky , Nanci Griffith , Jennifer Kimball , and Cliff Eberhardt .",
      "In context of spaceflight , a satellite is an artificial object which has been intentionally placed into orbit . Such objects are sometimes called artificial satellites to distinguish them from natural satellites such as Earth 's Moon .   In 1957 the Soviet Union launched the world 's first artificial satellite , Sputnik 1 . Since then , about 6,600 satellites from more than 40 countries have been launched . According to a 2013 estimate , 3,600 remained in orbit . Of those , about 1,000 were operational ; while the rest have lived out their useful lives and became space debris . Approximately 500 operational satellites are in low-Earth orbit , 50 are in medium-Earth orbit ( at 20,000 km ) , and the rest are in geostationary orbit ( at 36,000 km ) . A few large satellites have been launched in parts and assembled in orbit . Over a dozen space probes have been placed into orbit around other bodies and become artificial satellites to the Moon , Mercury , Venus , Mars , Jupiter , Saturn , a few asteroids , and the Sun .   Satellites are used for many purposes . Common types include military and civilian Earth observation satellites , communications satellites , navigation satellites , weather satellites , and space telescopes . Space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites . Satellite orbits vary greatly , depending on the purpose of the satellite , and are classified in a number of ways . Well-known ( overlapping ) classes include low Earth orbit , polar orbit , and geostationary orbit .   A launch vehicle is a rocket that throws a satellite into orbit . Usually it lifts off from a launch pad on land . Some are launched at sea from a submarine or a mobile maritime platform , or aboard a plane ( see air launch to orbit ) .   Satellites are usually semi-independent computer-controlled systems . Satellite subsystems attend many tasks , such as power generation , thermal control , telemetry , attitude control and orbit control .",

      "Sir William Blackstone ( 10 July 1723 -- 14 February 1780 ) was an English jurist , judge and Tory politician of the eighteenth century . He is most noted for writing the Commentaries on the Laws of England . Born into a middle-class family in London , Blackstone was educated at Charterhouse School before matriculating at Pembroke College , Oxford in 1738 . After switching to and completing a Bachelor of Civil Law degree , he was made a Fellow of All Souls , Oxford on 2 November 1743 , admitted to Middle Temple , and called to the Bar there in 1746 . Following a slow start to his career as a barrister , Blackstone became heavily involved in university administration , becoming accountant , treasurer and bursar on 28 November 1746 and Senior Bursar in 1750 . Blackstone is considered responsible for completing the Codrington Library and Warton Building , and simplifying the complex accounting system used by the college . On 3 July 1753 he formally gave up his practice as a barrister and instead embarked on a series of lectures on English law , the first of their kind . These were massively successful , earning him a total of # 453 ( # in terms ) , and led to the publication of An Analysis of the Laws of England in 1756 , which repeatedly sold out and was used to preface his later works .   On 20 October 1758 Blackstone was confirmed as the first Vinerian Professor of English Law , immediately embarking on another series of lectures and publishing a similarly successful second treatise , titled A Discourse on the Study of the Law . With his growing fame , Blackstone successfully returned to the bar and maintained a good practice , also securing election as Tory Member of Parliament for the rotten borough of Hindon on 30 March 1761 . In November 1765 he published the first of four volumes of Commentaries on the Laws of England , considered his magnum opus ; the completed work earned Blackstone # 14,000 ( # in terms ) . After repeated failures , he successfully gained appointment to the judiciary as a Justice of the Court of King 's Bench on 16 February 1770 , leaving to replace Edward Clive as a Justice of the Common Pleas on 25 June . He remained in this position until his death , on 14 February 1780 .   Blackstone 's legacy and main work of note is his Commentaries . Designed to provide a complete overview of English law , the four-volume treatise was repeatedly republished in 1770 , 1773 , 1774 , 1775 , 1778 and in a posthumous edition in 1783 . Reprints of the first edition , intended for practical use rather than antiquary interest , were published until the 1870s in England and Wales , and a working version by Henry John Stephen , first published in 1841 , was reprinted until after the Second World War . Legal education in England had stalled ; Blackstone 's work gave the law `` at least a veneer of scholarly respectability '' . William Searle Holdsworth , one of Blackstone 's successors as Vinerian Professor , argued that `` If the Commentaries had not been written when they were written , I think it very doubtful that -LSB- the United States -RSB- , and other English speaking countries would have so universally adopted the common law . '' In the United States , the Commentaries influenced Alexander Hamilton , John Marshall , James Wilson , John Jay , John Adams , James Kent and Abraham Lincoln , and remain frequently cited in Supreme Court decisions .",

      "Ali Pasha Mubarak ( 1823-Nov . 14 , 1893 CE ) was an Egyptian public works and education minister during the second half of the nineteenth century . He is often considered one of the most influential and talented of Egypt 's 19th century reformers . He was born in Birnbal al-Jididah , a Nile Delta village and attended a government prep school before being admitted to the Cairo School of Engineering . During his studies in Cairo he was the top student and as a result was chosen to be a member of a student mission sent by Muhammad Ali to France in 1844 . He studied in Paris for two years and directly after that in Metz at a school for artillery officers and military engineers . He returned to his homeland in 1849 and was given an instructors position in the artillery school . After this in 1850 , he became the first native Egyptian Muslim to be appointed the director of the entire system of government schools . This marked the beginning of his `` rich career of public service that spanned nearly four decades and included appointments as head of the ministries of education , public works , and railways . '' Ali Mubarak is known for his contribution in the reconstruction of Cairo 's landscape and for founding Egypt 's modern educational system .   His most famous work is titled al-Khitat al-Tawfiqiyya al-Jadida ( Tawfiq 's New Plans , referring to Egypt 's ruler at the time ) , which provides a detailed , street-by-street description of Egypt 's major cities and villages .   He also contributed to the start of the Egyptian National Library and Archives around 1870 which is one of the largest and oldest government libraries .",
      "New Worlds Fair is a 1975 concept album by UK rock group Michael Moorcock & The Deep Fix .   Moorcock was an established science fiction author who has contributed lyrics and occasionally performed with Hawkwind . In 1974 he was offered a record deal by Andrew Lauder , Hawkwind 's A&R man for United Artists Records , although Moorcock insisted that his compatriots Steve Gilmore and Graham Charnock should have significant input into the album .   The single `` Dodgem Dude '' / `` Starcruiser '' had been recorded just prior to the album , but United Artists passed on the idea of releasing it . Some time later as Moorcock was visiting his former manager Douglas Smith , with whom he was in dispute , he discovered the tapes for the single lying around the office . Without Smith 's knowledge he took them , passing them onto Frenchy Gloder , who gave the single a belated release on his Flicknife Records label ( FLS200 , December 1980 ) .   The album has received two re-releases featuring various bonus tracks , in 1995 on Griffin ( USA ) and Dojo ( UK ) , and in 2008 on Esoteric ( UK ) . In 2004 , Voiceprint Records released an alternate version of the album as Roller Coaster Holiday .",
      "`` Move '' is a song by British girl group Little Mix . It was released as the lead single from their second studio album , Salute ( 2013 ) . It was co-written by the group with Maegan Cottone and Nathan Duvall , and produced by the latter . An R&B song , that moves away from Little Mix 's previous melody-led ventures , featuring more quirky sounds with bass synth . The girl band stated that the song is about when a boy on the dance floor is `` acting too cool for school '' and they would like him to move . The single was made available for pre-ordering on iTunes on the same day as its radio impact without the official single artwork .   The single received its first airplay in the United Kingdom on 23 September 2013 and was released for digital download on 3 November 2013 , a week before the release of Salute in that country . It debuted and peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart .",
      "Cronobacter is the officially recognised bacterial genus name for the organism which before 2007 was named Enterobacter sakazakii . The name Enterobacter should no longer be used as the genus name as Cronobacter has been accepted in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology , along with the description of the new species .  . This is an opportunistic Gram-negative , rod-shaped , pathogenic bacterium that can live in very dry places . The majority of Cronobacter cases are adults but low-birth-weight preterm neonatal and older infants are highest at risk . The disease is associated with a rare cause of invasive infection infants with historically high case fatality rates ( 40 -- 80 % ) .   In infants it can cause bacteraemia , meningitis and necrotizing enterocolitis . Most neonatal C. sakazakii infections cases have been associated with the use of powdered infant formula with some strains able to survive in a desiccated state for more than two years . However , not all cases have been linked to contaminated infant formula . In November 2011 , several shipments of Kotex tampons were recalled due to a Cronobacter ( E. sakazakii ) contamination . There also was a study done where they found the strands of pathogen in 12 % of field vegetables and 13 % of hydroponic vegetables .   All Cronobacter species , except C. condimenti , have been linked retrospectively to clinical cases of infection in either adults or infants . However multilocus sequence typing has shown that the majority of neonatal meningitis cases in the past 30 years , across 6 countries have been associated with only one genetic lineage of the species Cronobacter sakazakii called ` Sequence Type 4 ' or ` ST4 ' , and therefore this clone appears to be of greatest concern with infant infections .   The bacterium is ubiquitous being isolated from a range of environments and foods , and the majority of Cronobacter cases are in the adult population . However it is the association with intrinsically or extrinsically contaminated powdered formula which has attracted the main attention . According to multilocus sequence analysis ( MLSA ) the genus originated ~ 40 MYA , and the most clinically significant species , C. sakazakii , was distinguishable ~ 15-23 MYA .  .",
      "Tonga Ma'a Tonga Kautaha ( Tonga for Tongans Cooperative ) was formed in Tonga in 1909 to export copra on behalf of its members , prior to which such exports had been controlled by a cartel of European traders who profited greatly from the trade but paid little to Tongan copra growers .   The cooperative was the idea of Alexander Donald Cameron , a trader from a Scottish family , who with the support of a noble titleholder , Vaea of Hauma , organised meetings in villages around Tongatapu , the main island in the Kingdom of Tonga , to explain its concept and enlist members . Cameron had its constitution drawn up by fellow expatriate Robert Hanslip , based on that of Tonga 's Free Church , which favoured Tongan autonomy and was the official church in Tonga of which most Tongan growers were members rather than of the Wesleyan Church favoured by the majority of European expatriates .   Formed as a commission agency that passed on to its members the exact overseas sale price less duty , freight and a modest commission that went to Cameron as its president , the cooperative was also viewed as a vehicle for Tongan aspirations and a means of acquiring business skills of non-indigenous residents .   The cooperative opened in May 1909 with 1,300 members and before the end of the year had 3,280 members from all three main islands in the kingdom - Tongatapu , Vava'u and Ha'apai - including many of Tonga 's most influential nobles and chiefs , comprising 60 per cent of the kingdom 's taxpayers , or landowners in terms of the Constitution , out of a population at that time of 22,000 .   As the cooperative prospered it began importing consumables for sale to its members , breaking a monopoly previously held by European traders who had pursued a two-tier policy of one price for their fellow expatriates and double that for Tongans .   The cooperative 's success drew the ire of the islands ' European traders , who through the support of the local British Agent caused it to be investigated , the Auditor General being given access to its books ( with Cameron 's blessing ) and presenting a report of his findings to its members that led to its closure by Tonga 's Premier on grounds of financial irregularities by Cameron , for which Cameron was subsequently charged . On appeal , Cameron was acquitted of any wrongdoing . He later attempted to reform the collective under the name Tonga Ma'a Tonga Company Limited with himself as general manager and now paid a salary rather than a commission , but it was not successful and ceased business in about 1916 .   The circumstances of the investigation , its outcome and in particular the heavy-handedness of William Telfer Campbell , the British Agent , in his dealings with the ruling monarch , King George Tupou II , led to a redefining of the role of that office in relation to advice given to the monarch , strengthening the latter 's authority and the nation 's autonomy .",

      "The Sabre Sprint is creation of Sabre Cars , formed in 1984 in Wallsend , Newcastle upon Tyne . The creation of Sabre Cars by Steven Crabtree came after years of producing fibreglass items ( canoes , boats , sunbeds ) and fibreglass car parts to other kit car brands . Steven decided it was time to design and create his own car . He designed and engineer the Sabre Sprint , produced between 1984 and 1986 . Its boxy features resemble that of an Escort MK3 or a Talbot Sunbeam .   Approx 110 cars were produced by Sabre Cars .   Created from an all fibreglass monocoque body reinforced with kevlar and carbon fibre at the mountings for extra strength . It used a classic mini front subframe and A-Series engine at the front , whilst at the rear a galvanised beam axle was used with classic mini radius arms and coilover suspension . The car had four seats and a boot area which could be accessed by tilting the rear seats .   MK1   The first design of the Sabre Sprint featured square headlights and an opening glass rear hatch .   MK2   Introduced only a year after the MK1 . The front was changed to twin round headlights and a redesigned rear featured a full opening hatch .   Hybrid ( MK1 .5 )  Hybrids of the MK1 and MK2 were created during the change over period at Sabre Cars . These cars feature the twin round headlight front but with the MK1 style opening glass hatch .   The sabre sprint vanished in 1986 , after approx 110 cars had been built . Some of them made it into motorsport , rallying , hill climbing and such due to the lightweight but strong design .   The Sabre moulds ended up the property of a nearby company .

      "The Big Ten Conference ( B1G ) , formerly Western Conference and Big Nine Conference , is the oldest Division I collegiate athletic conference in the United States . The conference , consisting of 14 members as of 2016 , competes in the NCAA Division I ; its football teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) , formerly known as Division I-A , the highest level of NCAA competition in that sport . The conference includes the flagship public university in each of 11 states stretching from New Jersey to Nebraska , as well as two additional public land grant schools and a private university .   The Big Ten Conference was established in 1895 when Purdue University president James H. Smart and representatives from the University of Chicago , University of Illinois , University of Michigan , University of Minnesota , Northwestern University , and University of Wisconsin gathered at Chicago 's Palmer House Hotel to set policies aimed at regulating intercollegiate athletics . In 1905 , the conference was officially incorporated as the `` Intercollegiate Conference Athletic Association '' .   Big Ten member institutions are predominantly major flagship research universities with large financial endowments and strong academic reputations . Large student enrollment is also a hallmark of Big Ten universities , as 12 of the 14 members feature enrollments of 30,000 or more students . Northwestern University , one of just two full members with a total enrollment of fewer than 30,000 students ( the other is the University of Nebraska -- Lincoln ) , is the lone private university among Big Ten membership ( the University of Chicago , a private university , left the conference in 1946 ) . Collectively , Big Ten universities educate more than 520,000 total students and have 5.7 million living alumni . Big Ten universities engage in $ 9.3 billion in funded research each year . Though the Big Ten existed for nearly a century as an assemblage of universities located primarily in the Midwest , the conference 's geographic footprint now spans from the state of Nebraska in the west to the Atlantic Ocean in the east .   Big Ten universities are also members of the Big Ten Academic Alliance , an academic consortium . In 2014 -- 2015 , members generated more than $ 10 billion in research expenditures . Despite the conference 's name , the Big Ten has grown to fourteen members , with the following universities accepting invitations to join : Pennsylvania State University in 1990 , the University of Nebraska -- Lincoln in 2011 , and both the University of Maryland and Rutgers University in 2014 . Johns Hopkins University was invited in 2012 to join the Big Ten as an associate member participating in men 's lacrosse only . In 2015 , it was also accepted as an associate member in women 's lacrosse . Notre Dame is scheduled to join the Big Ten in 2017 as an associate member in men 's ice hockey .",
