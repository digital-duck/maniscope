      "Fringe is an American science fiction television series created by J. J. Abrams , Alex Kurtzman , and Roberto Orci . It premiered on the Fox Broadcasting network on September 9 , 2008 , and concluded on January 18 , 2013 , after five seasons and 100 episodes . The series follows Olivia Dunham ( Anna Torv ) , Peter Bishop ( Joshua Jackson ) , and Walter Bishop ( John Noble ) , all members of the fictional Fringe Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , based in Boston , Massachusetts , under the supervision of Homeland Security . The team uses fringe science and FBI investigative techniques to investigate a series of unexplained , often ghastly occurrences , which are related to mysteries surrounding a parallel universe .   The series has been described as a hybrid of fantasy and procedural dramas and serials , influenced by film and television shows such as Lost , The X-Files , Altered States , and The Twilight Zone . The series began as a traditional mystery-of-the-week series and became more serialized in later seasons . Most episodes contain a standalone plot , with several others also exploring the series ' overarching mythology .   Critical reception was at first lukewarm but became more favorable after the first season , when the series began to explore its mythology , including parallel universes and alternate timelines . The show , as well as the cast and crew , were nominated for many major awards . Despite its move to the `` Friday night death slot '' and low ratings , the series developed a cult following . It also spawned two six-part comic book series , an alternate reality game , and three novels .",

      "The Purgi language ( alternative spellings : Purki , Purig , Purik and Burig ) is spoken by the Purikpa , a group of Tibetan Muslims , with a slight mixture with Dardic . The Purikpa live south of the Balti in Ladakh .   Most of them live in Ladakh and Baltistan , especially in Kargil although significant numbers reside in Leh . Many Puriks are also present in China .   Because they inhabit the higher reaches of the arid Himalayas , they depend on glacial runoff for irrigation of their crops . Barley , wheat and millet are grown where water is sufficient , especially along small rivers . The hot summer temperatures also allow for a wide variety of fruits to be raised .   Unlike the Dards and the Shina , the Purikpa are not nomads . They transfer their livestock from one grazing ground to another upon the arrival of autumn . During the summer months , they drive the cattle to alpine pastures . All households own at least one female dzo , which is a cross between a cow and a yak . That animal produces milk .   Most of them are Shia Muslims by religion although significant Sunni Muslims and a small minority of Buddhists and B\u00f6n followers reside in isolated areas .

      "Ecological genetics is the study of genetics in natural populations .   This contrasts with classical genetics , which works mostly on crosses between laboratory strains , and DNA sequence analysis , which studies genes at the molecular level .   Research in this field is on traits of ecological significance -- that is , traits related to fitness , which affect an organism 's survival and reproduction . Examples might be : flowering time , drought tolerance , polymorphism , mimicry , avoidance of attacks by predators .   Research usually involves a mixture of field and laboratory studies . Samples of natural populations may be taken back to the laboratory for their genetic variation to be analysed . Changes in the populations at different times and places will be noted , and the pattern of mortality in these populations will be studied . Research is often done on insects and other organisms that have short generation times .",

      "The South Island or Te Waipounamu ( M\u0101ori ) is the larger of the two major islands of New Zealand , the other being the smaller but more populous North Island . It is bordered to the north by Cook Strait , to the west by the Tasman Sea , and to the south and east by the Pacific Ocean . The South Island covers 150437 km2 and has a temperate climate .   It has a 32 percent larger landmass than the North Island so is sometimes referred to as the `` mainland '' of New Zealand , especially by South Island residents , but only 23 percent of New Zealand 's million inhabitants live there . In the early stages of European ( P\u0101keh\u0101 ) settlement of the country , the South Island had the majority of the European population and wealth due to the 1860s gold rushes . The North Island population overtook the South in the early 20th century , with 56 percent of the population living in the North in 1911 , and the drift north of people and businesses continued throughout the century .

      "Boethus of Sidon ( \u0392\u03cc\u03b7\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 c. 75 -- c. 10 BC ) was a Peripatetic philosopher from Sidon , who lived towards the end of the 1st century BC .   As he was a disciple of Andronicus of Rhodes , he must have travelled at an early age to Rome and Athens , in which cities Andronicus is known to have taught . Strabo , who mentions him and his brother Diodotus among the celebrated persons of Sidon , speaks of him at the same time as his own teacher ( or fellow pupil ) in Peripatetic philosophy . Among his works , all of which are now lost , there was one on the nature of the soul , and also a commentary on Aristotle 's Categories , which is mentioned by Ammonius in his commentary on the same work of Aristotle . Ammonius quotes also an opinion of Boethus concerning the study of the works of Aristotle , viz . that the student should begin with the Physics , whereas Andronicus had maintained that the beginning should be made with the Logic writings of Aristotle .   According to Giovanni Reale , in The Schools of the Imperial Age , ( pp. 18 -- 19 ) , Boethos believed that ` substance ' was ` matter ' -- that it was the composite of being , and not the individual form of being . Thus `` form falls outside of the category of substance and enters into the scope of other categories '' . The significance of this is that individuality is not only how we understand and interpret reality , but is actually the basic nature of that reality . That ` true reality ' was not some universal substance , but consisted of individual forms .   Similarly , in ethics , he declared that `` the original goal ( the proton oikeion ) towards which we tend is ourselves in relation to ourselves . In agreement with that view , he says that we do not love anyone in preference to ourselves and finally that we only love others in reference to ourselves '' ."

      "Thomas Russell Williams ( 1869 -- 1926 ) was a British socialist politician .   Williams grew up in Huddersfield and largely educated himself . He entered the textile industry and rose to become manager of a mill . He tried to enter the civil service , but was rejected , and instead turned his attention to the trade union movement . He became interested in ethical socialism and joined the Independent Labour Party ( ILP ) , serving on its national council , though never becoming a figure well-known to the public .   Williams stood as the Labour Representation Committee candidate for Huddersfield at the 1906 general election . He was initially selected by the local trades council , and only later gained the backing of the ILP , against the private wishes of Ramsay MacDonald . He believed that he had a strong chance of winning the seat , but ultimately took a close second place , with 35.2 % of the vote , on an extremely high turnout of 94 % of eligible voters .   Williams stood again at the Huddersfield by-election , 1906 , for the renamed Labour Party , but again lost narrowly , his vote dropping slightly to 33.8 % . Although blaming this on the disqualification of some working class voters , he also admitted that the party had failed to make new converts .   Williams lost further favour with the ILP leadership after he endorsed Victor Grayson in his successful independent labour campaign at the Colne Valley by-election , 1907 . However , he was selected for Spen Valley , taking 23.3 % of the vote at the January 1910 general election . In anticipation of an election in 1914 or 1915 , he was made Labour 's Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Darlington , but was not happy as he felt there was little chance of winning the seat , and by the time the 1918 general election came around , there was no Labour candidate in the town .   Williams died in 1926 .",
      "Damper is a traditional Australian soda bread , historically prepared by swagmen , drovers , stockmen and other travellers . It consists of a wheat flour based bread , traditionally baked in the coals of a campfire or in a in a camp oven . Damper is an iconic Australian dish . It is also made in camping situations in New Zealand , and has been for many decades .   Damper was originally developed by stockmen who travelled in remote areas for long periods , with only basic rations of flour , sugar and tea , supplemented by whatever meat was available . The basic ingredients of damper were flour , water , and sometimes milk . Baking soda could be used for leavening . The damper was normally cooked in the ashes of the camp fire . The ashes were flattened , and the damper was cooked there for ten minutes . Following this , the damper was covered with ashes and cooked for another 20 to 30 minutes until the damper sounded hollow when tapped . Alternatively , the damper was cooked in a greased camp oven . Damper was eaten with dried or cooked meat or golden syrup , also known as `` cocky 's joy '' .   Damper is also a popular dish with Indigenous Australians . Aboriginal women had traditionally made bush bread from seasonal grains and nuts . Today , a variety of different recipes for damper are available online .",

      "The Raven is a 2012 American psychological thriller drama film directed by James McTeigue , produced by Marc D. Evans , Trevor Macy and Aaron Ryder and written by Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare . It stars John Cusack , Alice Eve , Brendan Gleeson and Luke Evans .   Set in 1849 , it is a fictionalized account of the last days of Edgar Allan Poe 's life , in which the poet and author pursues a serial killer whose murders mirror those in Poe 's stories . While the plot of the film is fictional , the writers based it on some accounts of real situations surrounding Edgar Allan Poe 's mysterious death . Poe is said to have repeatedly called out the name `` Reynolds '' on the night before his death , though it is unclear to whom he was referring . The title derives from Poe 's poem `` The Raven '' , in the similar manner of the earlier unrelated 1935 and 1963 films .   It was released in Canada , Ireland , and the United Kingdom on March 9 , 2012 and in the United States on April 27 , 2012 . It was a moderate commercial success , receiving $ 1.7 million more than its budget , but garnering near-negative reviews , with the visual effects and score by Lucas Vidal praised , but the performances and plot twists criticized .",

      "Multicellular organisms are organisms that consist of more than one cell , in contrast to unicellular organisms .   All species of animals , land plants and most fungi are multicellular , as are many algae , whereas a few organisms are partially uni - and partially multicellular , like slime molds and social amoebae such as the genus Dictyostelium .   Multicellular organisms arise in various different ways , for example by cell division or by aggregation of many single cells . Colonial organisms are the result of many identical individuals joining together to form a colony . However , it can often be hard to separate colonial protists from true multicellular organisms , because the two concepts are not distinct ; colonial protists have been dubbed `` pluricellular '' rather than `` multicellular '' ."
