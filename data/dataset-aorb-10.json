      "Ball pythons (Python regius) are oviparous snakes, laying clutches of 4-10 eggs. Female pythons exhibit maternal care by coiling around their eggs and using muscular contractions to regulate temperature during the 55-60 day incubation period. They can raise egg temperature by up to 7\u00b0C above ambient through thermogenesis.",
      "Python 3.11 introduces improved error messages and performance optimizations. The new exception groups feature allows multiple exceptions to be raised and handled simultaneously, making error handling more robust in concurrent programming scenarios.",
      "Reticulated pythons reach sexual maturity at 3-4 years of age. Breeding season typically occurs between September and March, with females producing pheromones to attract males. Multiple males may compete for a single female, engaging in combat rituals.",
      "The asyncio library in Python provides infrastructure for writing concurrent code using async/await syntax. It is particularly useful for IO-bound and high-level structured network programming, handling multiple connections simultaneously.",
      "Green tree pythons undergo ontogenetic color change, with juveniles being bright yellow or red before transitioning to the characteristic green coloration at 6-12 months of age. This adaptation helps camouflage them in rainforest canopies.",

      "Python constriction mechanics involve applying pressure of 20-30 kPa, which disrupts blood flow rather than causing asphyxiation. Death in prey typically results from circulatory arrest within 3-5 minutes of constriction initiation."
